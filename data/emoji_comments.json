They were built different back than and were true patriots to and for me, you and our great USA.  He had about 10+ other surgeries after that also only 2 related and the others are large portions of small and large intestines, a kidney, appendix and gallbladder, and with all that being said he is told to be quite healthy still and has good blood pressure and still has nicer real teeth than 85% of my family (I got his teeth and full name, and my moms good hair and teeth side thankfully.)  TY to your father for being a true beast and giving his time life and dedication to all of us and all who serve our country to serve a greater good, you are the real heroes! shoutout to all the Police, Firemen, Paramedics and EMTs, and volunteers. We The People, the one(s) who love this land and the men and women who created the system we use today, yes there may be flaws but everything has flaws, but im proud to be from a County I can have a say in what I wear, do, eat, if i can or cant drive, own weapons to protect myself and my family.

I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2020 because the market outburst in December 2020 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2020 it didn&#39;t work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.<br>I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform.<br>Here is his contact via <br>Email Address:Ronsonbaylor @gmail .com<br>Tele gram: @Expert_Baylorfx<br>WhatsApp: ☎️+ 1 5 0 9 3 4 2 7 0 7 7...",

If you watch Johns body language and his manner of speaking it’s evident that John is probably under the influence and definitely miserable. I admire him so much because he went to rehab and is now sober. When I see him doing a bit now he looks healthy and happy. Plus he is funnier than ever! He’s been through so much and he is a true inspiration to those struggling with addiction.  Hats off to you John!❤",

His reaction to when he realizes where he&#39;s putting it, and what might be seen from the outside - you see him clearly react quickly by closing it shut, and opening only very slightly the 2nd time to try to put the pad of paper in there. In fact, he doesn&#39;t even put it in the pocket. So its almost like he&#39;s on auto-pilot, just trying to hang on to any semblance of sobriety and meaningful presence. <br><br>I say this as someone who has had plenty of problems with addiction and mental health. I&#39;ve been where he was at here. His new special on netflix is surprisingly relatable... I never got into his stuff until now.

The media and especially the news is the 1% who don&#39;t want to be taxed or have their power curtailed. Hopefully Trump will finally be in jail for trying to overturn the 2024 election. How much did it cost us in recounts and court cases because his ego was too fragile to admit he lost? I hope they strip him of every dime he has to reimburse the taxpayers. Happy 2024!

I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can’t even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn’t even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren’t for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn’t have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what’s really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I’ll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times.

Their peaceful and generous natures make them ideal neighbors, not to mention their exceptional family values, tight knit traditional families, and parenting skills unrivaled by any other culture. Their culture-wide commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people. Real estate values are fueled by the mix of African Americans into an area due to the caring and respectful nature of their communities, all of which are shining examples of their achievements garnered through enthusiasm for self-improvement and hard work combined with their joyful, self-reliant can-do spirits. Without their industrious and creative drive, their edified and kind natures, the shining obvious example of their culture wide ethos, their stunning ability to police themselves and raise their children to be educated adults and people of substance, importance and inherent worth, we would most undoubtedly be poorer as a nation and a city.💪💪💪💯💯💯",

    "2350": "No tenían tanta competencia, no sacaban grupos cada 6 meses como ahora, además llenaron el vacío de 2ne1 (yg Entertainment las obligó a renunciar y desintegrar el grupo por ser &quot;gordas, prietas y feas&quot;).<br>🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️<br>YG ENTERTAINMENT:<br>Su empresa tiene varias demandas y sospechas de todo tipo, su fundador esta en la cárcel, el teddy y el dany chungs han hecho comentarios sexistas y machistas en el pasado, el ex ceo tiene antecedentes de pedofilia, drogas y lavado de dinero, varios famosos de allí ya les comprobaron drogas y cosas ilícitas y los escándalos sexuales libertinos de blackpink y su bajo rendimiento etc... Etc... Es obvio que esa empresa trata de mantenerse a flote pero yo espero que quiebre.<br>Algo podrido pudre todo lo demás, donde trabajas habla mucho de alguien.<br>ES LA MALDICIÓN DE blackpink, ELLAS ARRUINARON EL KPOP EN LA ERA MEDIOCRE DE ICE CREAM, SE CORROMPIERON.<br>✨Esos sonidos, ritmos y melodías de money, flower y solo, entre otras canciones más de blackpink ya existían, el teddy mezcla y convina ritmos ya existentes, ese teddy recicla las melodías (yo solo escucho el instrumental sintetizador de Teddy &amp; Danny Chung sin las voces playback de blackpink). La canción you &amp; me, flower y solo: Estas músicas son bonitas sin necesidad de las voces mediocres de jennie y jisoo. Cantantes como iu, twice, niziu, aespa, nmixx y etc. podrían cantarlas mucho mejor que jennie y jisoo sin problemas (todas las canciones de blackpink y sin necesidad de que canten, yo solo escucho el instrumental). Twice saco como 3 canciones diferentes de moon light antes que blackpink.<br>No entiendes. Los ritmos de blackpink son el revoltijo de varias canciones y músicas del pasado pero ni siquiera dan créditos, ni siquiera lo dicen, eso es descaro y sinismo. No dan créditos y no explican la inspiración. En cambio jyp si trata de crear melodías nuevas. Yg Entertainment ni siquiera lo intenta, todo lo recicla. Por eso suena tan bien la música de bp porque son sonidos, ritmos y melodías familiares del pasado. No es nada nuevo para el oído.<br>Lo que no saben es que teddy oppa les pone la música de fondo reciclada y mezclada de ritmos del pasado ya existentes y aparte les ayuda a que las palabras que ellas escriben rimen/escriban riman.<br>Mis padres y abuelos de más de 70 y 80 años tarareaban y cantaban canciones y melodías que se han perdido con el tiempo, porque cuando salieron no existía el Internet, ni donde guardarlas y en sus tiempos de infantes y jóvenes fueron muy populares pero hay muchas cosas y acontecimientos que se han perdido en la historia porque no quisieron darles difusión y los testigos se han ido muriendo.<br><br>En casi todas las canciones se autoafirman, se jactan y se vanaglorian (&quot;tanto tienes es lo que tanto vales&quot;, no se trata de tener más bienes y posesiones materiales para tener valor, si no de tener más dignidad, ética, moral, honor y santidad), pero los hechos dicen lo contrario, ellas son palabras no hechos y las palabras se las lleva el viento. Lo único que tienen aparte de dinero es vanagloria y la vanagloria es pasajera, si continúan enviando mensajes vanos y vacíos acabarán muy mal.<br>Sus letras son muy apáticas y antifeministas, necesitan humillar a &quot;su competencia&quot; para sentirse bien con ellas mismas. Una cosa es escuchar su música y ver sus videos y otra es obsesionarse y querer todo lo que ellas tienen o promueven. No sean ridículos como los idólatras de bp.<br>Cuando algo es pegadizo es porque solo se trata de cantar y ya, a eso se le llama comercial y mercadotecnia. Sus canciones eran pegadizas como los soundtracks de comerciales pero definitivamente les ayudo mayormente el hecho de ser embajadoras de ropas y accesorios muy bonitos.<br>Si gente rica o famosa usa algún producto los demás pobres creen y piensan que es de buena calidad y por eso comienzan a usarlo. A veces si es de buena calidad y otras veces es solo mercadotecnia. <br><br>Para mi la prostitución y la venta sexual es abominable y deberían prohibirla y el gobierno y la humanidad no deberían permitir que exista la pobreza ni las clases bajas, porque por culpa de estos pedorros pretextos y excusas existe el comercio sexual que es aborrencentemente ominoso y merece ser condenado, nunca debió existir el comercio sexual. <br>Que asco que la adultez occidental sea sinónimo de promiscuidad, que te restrieguen cuerpos ajenos en el tuyo, que los penes penetren las vaginas y las vaginas sean penetradas por diferentes penes, todo muy mal, en ese caso mejor sería que se quedarán como niños para siempre, pues de niños obedecen y están en ética y moral (pureza y dignidad, al menos la mayoría) pero si ser adulto es corromperte y llamar a lo malo bueno y a lo bueno malo, de nada aprovecha ser mayor de edad, ser adulto no significa que te corrompas y perviertas, deberían todos querer vivir hasta hacerse viejos con sabiduría, dignidad y santidad.<br>Yo no apoyo a nadie que no tenga los mismos principios y valores éticos y morales, por eso para mi es muy importante saber y conocer quienes son las personas a las que yo les consumo para no perder mi tiempo, a que dedican el tiempo libre y su vida privada, así hago con todas las empresas de cualquier tipo y cuando les descubro sus cochinadas, inmediatamente les dejo de consumir y para mi es antietico y antimoral tener varias relaciones románticas y aún más si tienen sexo con cada pareja.<br><br>✨Si no fuera porque existe la idolatría no existirían famosos, cantantes, bailarines ni ningún tipo de artista rico, millonario o multimillonario. <br>Algunos grupos tienen éxito por tanta propaganda, comerciales y colaboraciones más que por su propio talento y esfuerzo.<br>Se supone que entrenaron para cantar y bailar, se supone que esa es su vocación pero ahora muchas y muchos usan el canto y el baile para escalar a ser modelos, influencias y actores. Todo muy mal, concéntrense en ser cantantes y bailarines primero, de lo contrario mejor hubieran estudiado actuación, modelaje o diseñador de modas.<br>✨El kpop no convirtió en un logro nada, plagiaron a los negros con tonos y estilos más pasteles y menos pesados y rudos y usaron marcas prestigiosas para ayudarse mutuamente pero las marcas que ellos representan ya estaban muy posicionadas antes de que ellos fueran embajadores...<br>Y la mayoría no son artistas, solo son famosos en una industria de plástico no de música y arte.<br>Los coreanos siempre han querido igualar a los países primer mundistas europeos y de estados unidos y los han imitado en muchas áreas, formas, maneras, aspectos y sentidos. Tan solo mira sus doramas, series, películas, sus ropas, prendas, accesorios y escenarios, todo lo visual es de un occidente elitista y clasista.<br>✨Idol es ídolo, se supone que es un ejemplo a seguir, debe cumplir con estándares ideales y utópicos, políticamente correctos pero resulta que actualmente ningún ídolo es un ejemplo ético y moral perfecto a seguir.<br>El kpop es pop coreano que cantan en coreano, que combinan varios ritmos (además el pop coreano usa palabras y frases en inglés y tiene apropiación cultural) y aunque esta mujer no la consideran idola, ella es cantante y bailarina que canta en coreano como otros cantantes y bailarines del pop coreano que cantan coreano. Y repito ningún cantante y bailarín de corea del sur y del mundo en general, sin importar que género cantan y bailan es un ejemplo digno a seguir y de idolatrar. Así que esto no tiene nada que ver con que otros cantantes y bailarines coreanos besen, abracen y muestren afección física y tierna a sus fans, deberían hacerlo.<br>Con blackpink se destruye el concepto idol inicial. Ya no lo son, ahora son como los cantantes y la música en inglés de estados unidos.<br><br>✨A quien no le guste mi comentario, tienen el poder de bloquearme, así nunca me verán. No sean inmaduros y bloqueenme si no pueden ignorarme, pero, querer censurarme solo porque no les gusta mi pensar es innecesario y eso es Imposición de programación predictiva y propaganda de inclusión y lo políticamente correcto (eso fue lo que hicieron los grandes tiranos del mundo como hitler, roma y los judios con Jesús y varios dictadores). ¿Duras son mis palabras para ustedes? Ignorenme, así como yo los tengo que soportar en este planeta.<br>📖si leyeras más seguido no sería biblia. Aprende a leer, hazte ese hábito, lo que tu quieras puedes leer. Si leyeras la biblia no hubieras escrito eso, porque la biblia verdaderamente es mucho texto. Esto no es nada.<br>🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍🤍💗🤍",

As everyone noticed, all the other balls just clumped together at the bottom of the &#39;well&#39;, which is not what occurs ! Space is actually four dimensional, time representing movement. Visualize space as a medium instead of a flat fabric, which gets more dense the more mass forms, time also slows down near more mass, and seems to speed up for less massive objects in more spread out space ? I guess because it&#39;s hard to visualize and describe with words, physicists invented symbols with which to write formulas.🤨😁",

    "3900": "I can say now that I&#39;m grown and that I hid from the things this little girl is so strong to stand up to. As a kid I also saw people and much scarier things that shouldn&#39;t bleed thru to our world. After years of torture and being harassed by shadow people, one specifically I called the rubber man, he was blacker than black and shiny, and also a 2ft troll of some kind that my mother also saw. We didn&#39;t tell each other for 6 months. Things would jump on our beds and growl in our faces. Our piano would play at random times after my husband brought home a brief case from a garage sale. I know some ghosts need help, but I wasn&#39;t in a place to do that and I think that&#39;s why I attracted the nastiest of the paranormal. These children are so intelligent and kind and strong, the support they have is amazing. One of my friends was upset because I saw her dad walk thru a room, I didn&#39;t know what to say? We were close so I just explained what I saw with as much detail as I could. She pulls out a picture and he&#39;s wearing the same black and white flannel I just described. She had been trying to see him for a few years and couldn&#39;t understand why it didn&#39;t happen for her but it did for me. We decided to go to a spiritual camp in Florida for the weekend so she could speak with a psychic. This camp had Dr&#39;s with their PHD&#39;s from all over the world who come and study for months. Sorry this is long but there&#39;s a point lol. Immediately getting there I wasn&#39;t feeling well, when I opened the door to our room I saw a woman for 1 sec but I described her by detail, brown hair in a bun, delicate features, high lace collar dress with a ribbon in her hair, I gasped a second 😂 when I saw her I am always thrown off even tho I see it everyday! So  that night we were supposed to go on a small walk to where the lay lines are located basically I guess it&#39;s easier to reach the other side. Sort of like a portal I&#39;m assuming? But before that we went on a walk and I smelled the most awful smell as an animal must have died... She didn&#39;t smell it and I knew because it&#39;s happened before, I knew it was bad. Finally night comes for our walk to the area where we should see orbs, and to my surprise I saw 2 nobody else saw. I wasn&#39;t feeling well so I told my friend to enjoy herself and I walked up to sit outside at a table by the restaurant. I saw a woman across the area and she asked to join me 😊 well of course!!! But the next thing out of her mouth shook me, do you know you are a very powerful psychic? I just froze lol... I mentioned we were there to learn about her dad but I&#39;ve pretty much known something was going on with me. My entire life has been this way and now I&#39;m facing it straight on. I said what does that mean exactly. She explained she has psychic abilities but I have all the abilities and most have one. This was me 😳 years I&#39;ve known all my life, I know when celebrities are going to pass which is awful to say but I see it in my mind and it happens. Mentioning this to my friends is a buzz kill but I mean you try being me. I was then told by this person that she has never seen so many dead people around one psychic. 30, there were 30. I was then later stopped by one of the DRs the next day as she was passing by and she asked if we could talk a min. Again, of course! I have to tell you I&#39;ve never seen someone with 3 spirit guides. She named one of these spirit guides and my mouth dropped. When I was born I was covered completely in a white veil and if you know native American history this means something. My mom took me to a shaman to see what this meant because we have family who still live on reservations. He explained to her what it meant, gave me a blessing and I learned all this when I was a teenager. When she said the name of my spirit guide, same name as the shaman!! Deango, I know I&#39;m spelling it all wrong. But my mom could not believe they knew the name. So this DR. Then tells me I have many abilities and she would like to teach me how to live with this and how to use it. She said I have the ability to see people for one second but I see them in my mind in full detail, I know things before they happen, I have the ability somehow to think of something and it will happen but in the way say I&#39;m thinking man I wish I had some iced tea and my husband comes home with it? This is a daily occurrence so am I the problem or are we just linking up I have no idea 😂😂 she said I know past things I shouldn&#39;t know, I can see things from other dimensions, like the shadow people and the troll. How did she know all this? She was running a class every Wednesday night and basically wanted me to be the main event 😳 still not sure about all that but I&#39;m getting better at accepting it. I lived an hour away so there was no way for me to commit to every Wednesday but the time I spent there was very educational. Learning to use my abilities the way these beautiful children do ❤ sorry it&#39;s a long one 😬",

I am a slider which means I have an extremely high electric field, I don’t interfere with anything electronic on purpose, it just happens out of the blue and usually when I am upset. What this little has is something different to me although she may be similar in many ways to me. These are powers or gifts that we have. I can hear spirits too but not as strong as her. I can read people and I can feel energy fields. People give off energy, and I am sorry to say this the energy or thoughts that people have aren’t good, their intentions aren’t good and I can feel everyone of them. It really drains my energy to the point where it’s hard to breath. I can only spend a little time around people. I do have people that I converse with who are beautiful souls so I do have friends.

    "4288": "Perfect song to end this Kobe Bryant memorial segment😢",
    "4289": "Almost 4 years. Man like Kobe never dies. Still surreal. Still remember where I was, what I was doing when that notification suddenly popped up on my phone. Middle of the night, completely at the opposite end of the world in Bangladesh 🇧🇩. It was way past bedtime and I had a rough day. That news shook me to the last bone in my spine. Didn&#39;t have a wink of sleep. <br><br>We love our sports here in Bangladesh. Football (what you call soccer) and cricket (baseball&#39;s older cousin) rules over here. Among American sports, basketball has a niche following because it is easy to understand and the entertainment value is probably second to none. But names like Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, LeBron James resonates to everybody. These names transcend the sport they represent, heck, transcend sports itself.<br><br>Some people in life you think would always be there being the kings that they are. Kobe was one of them. Whatever he touched turned into gold. Imagine winning an Oscar a couple of years after retiring as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Imagine the talent, the sheer will a man needs to have to accomplish these sorts of things. <br><br>I still find it hard to come to terms with the fact that Kobe Bryant isn’t walking on this planet amongst us mortals. You know what though. I don&#39;t believe one second has gone by in the last four years when the name Kobe Bryant wasn’t remembered by someone at some corner of this planet. Yes man only lived till 41, but if THAT is not an accomplished life, I don&#39;t know what is.<br><br>Rest in peace Mamba. The world is a worse off place without you.",
    "4290": "I still struggle to accept he is gone 😞",
    "4291": "I&#39;m German and only knew Kobe from seeing him in one early episode of &quot;Modern Family&quot;. I was never a big sports fan, but after that episode I saw him on TV like in the news or somewhere, and whenever he appeared on the screen, I got happy. I don&#39;t know why, but this man had a talent of making people smile by just existing, just showing up. Just by seeing him. When the news broke of his passing, I hoped so much that it was untrue. I was in shock to find out that it was true and it didn&#39;t only take him, but other innocent people, including his daughter. I still smile when I see him. He was such a great guy. He is missed. And will forever be missed, loved and remembered. He&#39;s taking care of his big girl up there ❤",

Why? God must have  them doing extra-special work in heaven.<br>✨🌟✨❤️✨🏀✨🌟<br>Que Dios bendiga a la familia🙏🏽",
    "4298": "Goodbye, Kobe and Gianna, rest in peace, we will miss you so much. You were an inspiring star for youth in sports and basketball. Goodbye champ. <br>.☝🏽😎",
    "4299": "I&#39;ll never forget that morning that he died. I live in L.A. County, walked outside to get the newspaper, and could barely see through the thickness of the fog. It was unbelievably foggy and remained that way for most of the morning. I received a text message from my sister, asking me if it was true that Kobe died in a helicopter crash. My heart felt like it stopped, yet, I thought it was absurd. I searched online and there were ZERO reports about his death. She bartends and one of the customers who had just walked in told her he found out that his friend had just died in a helicopter crash, along with Kobe. I turned on the TV and NOTHING was on. I flipped channels frantically. Then my mom said that someone on the radio confirmed it. I kept flipping the channels and finally, one channel broke in with the news. It was like I had to see it to believe it. He was my age. I wasn&#39;t his biggest fan, but my God, I cried every day for a week. 💔",

They kept whispering about it and wondering if it was, but thinking, “What would Bill Murray be doing in a grocery store here of all places?” So they followed him for a couple of minutes and one of the two guys who were with him said, “Hey, Bill…” Then they felt sure it was him, but they still didn’t approach him because they didn’t want to bother him.<br><br>Then when I was 13, I was out with a friend and when I got home my parents said another friend called. I didn’t call her back because I was tired and I knew I would see her on the school bus the next day. So I got on the school bus the next morning and sat with her, and I apologized for not calling her back and that’s when she told me I missed my opportunity to meet Tom Cruise who stayed in the hotel her mom managed that night, literally half a mile from my house. 🤦‍♀️",

O mankind in rural and urban areas, I shall say a word <del>by the permission of Allaah</del> and His command, and neither I nor you have any choice in the matter and know that everything to do with this matter is in Allaah&#39;s hands. So know with knowledge of certainty that Allaah will Achieve His purpose, and you shall know that the bisht (Arabic: بِشت; is a traditional cloak for Arab men) is another sign. Thence, listen to, comprehend, and grasp this news from Lord of the worlds that no pledge of allegiance will be paid to a king in Saudi Arabia after the death of King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud except to Allaah&#39;s caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. Also, know with certainty of mind that His Royal Highness King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz is dead and his son Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. O people, history is repeating itself! May Allaah Himself fights against you, how perverse are you! You have indeed reminded me of the dramatic play of the living martyr, Ali Abdullah Saleh Affash. Perhaps all the supporters of Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani would like to say: &quot; O our Imam, we are not done yet with the trial of the scenario of the murder of Leader Ali Abdullah Saleh despite the fact that he is still alive for the sake of far-reaching wisdom of Allaah; according to a ruling of yours. Until when we forget him and the people who have greatly argued us worldwide by the death of Leader Ali Abdullah Saleh, we again find them arguing us about his murder, but what do we have to do with Leader Ali Abdullah Saleh?! And now we are running into the trial of the owner of the bisht you wore on the military uniform&quot;. Then Allaah&#39;s caliph on the world, Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, smiles, laughing at your utterance, and says: &quot;O my beloved ones in Allaah&#39;s love, I have not done it out of my own accord, and what I know with knowledge of certainty is that there will be no king in Saudi Arabia after the death of King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud because Allaah will grant me dominion over Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and the whole world; Making me His caliph on the kingdom of the global throne of Allaah&#39;s caliph on the earth; Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, that is the promise of Allaah and He never Breaks His promises, in line with the Word of Allaah the Exalted:<br>{ قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَاءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَاءُ ۖ بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ ‎﴿٢٦﴾ } آل عمران<br>{Say, &quot;O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are Most Capable of everything (26)} <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QDTo8e6KYc&amp;t=3m26s\">3:26</a>&quot;<br>O my beloved ones in Allaah&#39;s love, the ball is in the court of Al Saud (the House of Saud) now, and it is better for them to yield to the fate and pre-destiny of Allaah as they have no other choice. What is the worth of the kingdom of Yemen and Saudi Arabia comparing to the worth of the dominion of the earth ,in the whole world? So let the people of Yemen and Hejaz accept Allaah&#39;s choice of His caliph on the whole world; Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, and let them all completely enter into submission to Allaah, for this is the decisive solution for the whole world, and if you refused, know that Allaah is Almighty and All-Wise and know that Allaah will achieve His purpose. Furthermore, Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani is waiting in full dignity until the Caliphate comes at his doorstep; like it or not! Certainly, fabrications in Saudi Arabia will not benefit them at all and I understand their Security situation so I shall choose for them a prince from their family to rule them for a time, a prince who has experienced bitter injustice in order to keep the Glorified House of Allaah safe along with the safety of all of Al Saud and the Arab people of Hijaz; that is His Royal Highness Prince Mutaib Bin Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. However, if Al Saud refused the command of Allaah&#39;s caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani like the people of Yemen had done before, thus Allaah let them taste the torment of the 3rd degree which they are still tasting until this very moment, (Al Saud would experience the same torment)<br>As for King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, I offer my condolences to the government of KSA and the people of Hejaz on the death of King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. On the other hand, if Allaah had awakened Mohammed Bin Salman from his clinical death so he received President Abdul-Fattah El-Sisi, let him speak out loud because he is neither deaf nor dumb, but far is that from happening<br>O the impersonator of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, you should be ashamed of these silent, deaf, and dumb videos of you before the eyes of the viewers and Abdul-Fattah El-Sisi certainly knows this. Moreover, allow me to announce the death of King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, and may Allaah bestows His mercy upon him, he indeed torments whomever He wills and forgives whomever he wills. Also, what I want to say is according to my knowledge, fabrications should be used for a limited time; not limitless! And I know you are elaborating fabrications on the hope that the Saudi Crown Prince wakes up from clinical death but far is that from happening... Also, I am afraid for those who elaborate fabrications and turn people away from the signs of verification from Lord of the worlds to be hit by the firm plan of Allaah (COVID) as no one feels safe from the plan of Allaah except the unjust ones<br>In addition, if Allaah had awakened Mohammed Bin Salman, let him speak in a video to the world as we used to see him do because he is not dumb, and these deaf and dumb videos you transmit are a shame on you and whoever helped you fabricate them because lying would not lead anywhere until Mohammed Bin Salman speaks while the Saudi people hear his voice and see him on video; verily Allaah shall cause the truth to triumph through His perfect Words<br>Peace be upon the messengers and praise be to Allaah Lord of the worlds<br>Allaah&#39;s caliph and servant; Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani<br><i>______________</i><br>📌(To read the statement in clear and coordinated writing kindly visit the official website of the Awaited Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani or search Google using the statement&#39;s title):<br>&quot;A Challenge From Allaah&#39;s Caliph; Al-Mahdi&quot;<br>1<br>لا توجد <br>lD4m9z",

Oblique means off to the side or two-faced. Destroy our reputation or career or health by exercising &quot;influence&quot; rather than force to try to get you to hurt yourself.<br>I said that to make this point. <br>Food and drink can be weaponized. Weaponized food and drink is dangerous.<br>They&#39;ll suckered you into eating a line of products will ultimately undermine your health, and make money off you profit from medical treatments. They treat but they never cure. They just make people sicker and sicker to create a stream of income.

He says ok and I ask why don&#39;t you just go to a pawn shop they&#39;d give you way more than 20 and he says he doesn&#39;t have an I.D. I asked him how are you driving a car with no I.D. and he says sorry my English is bad. Something want adding up.. I lost $20. The guy let me see his Rolex and it was soo obviously fake.
