I would bet anything that this guy had he’s hand in he’s so called childhood friend little brother abduction and death ! That’s why he must of killed he’s bigger brother as well he had to know ! They found the body of that little boy in the same spot where he’s bigger brother body was ! And it was this guy alpo who killed rich porter so I would bet everything he was part of it not saying he tortured or killed that kid but definitely had to knew about it he admitted that he killed he’s bigger brother when he knew specially what was going on he came to him for help to try to get back he’s little brother he shoot him to death💀 and took he’s coke or money like a small amount .. so it’s very interesting.. either way he was a demon ! So who ever shoot him to death just did a favour and justice for so many family’s ❤ 🙏 ..",

She was an angel with an evolved gender that nobody today understands yet. Her family abused her. Her church abused her. HER ENTIRE COMMUNITY ABUSED HER FOR BEING TRANS\/FOR BEING WHAT THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND‼️<br><br><br>She struck back at the community that struck her first. 🤷🏾‍♂️ Shyit happens. An eye for an eye like the Bible says, right? She actually got revenge not just for her but for the whole LGBTQ+ Community that is still being beat down on by Christians everywhere‼️‼️ just watch Fox News and you&#39;ll see.<br><br>She wanted to die cuz her whole adult life everybody around her told her she was evil for being trans and going to hell.

I have no opinion about Kelly Ripa one way or another but it infuriates me when people jump to conclusions, especially about a person&#39;s character, without &quot;researching&quot; for themselves first. It&#39;s her experience and her story to tell and only she and Regis (and maybe Gelman and Art Moore) really know what went on. And while not relevant to this specific conversation about KR&#39;s book, what&#39;s even scarier is that you&#39;re the kind of people who vote based on sound bites and TV commercials instead of finding out what candidates really represent. THAT&#39;S what you all should be talking about.<br>Oh, I find it very interesting how Kathie Lee has seemed to all of a sudden be popping up on various programs talking about how she&#39;s &quot;not going to read Kelly&#39;s book.&quot; 🤔<br>Also, curiously, this good Christian woman is best friends with --- wait for it --- Kris Kardashian Jenner.

Their peaceful and generous natures make them ideal neighbors, not to mention their exceptional family values, tight knit traditional families, and parenting skills unrivaled by any other culture. Their culture-wide commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people. Real estate values are fueled by the mix of African Americans into an area due to the caring and respectful nature of their communities, all of which are shining examples of their achievements garnered through enthusiasm for self-improvement and hard work combined with their joyful, self-reliant can-do spirits. Without their industrious and creative drive, their edified and kind natures, the shining obvious example of their culture wide ethos, their stunning ability to police themselves and raise their children to be educated adults and people of substance, importance and inherent worth, we would most undoubtedly be poorer as a nation and a city.💪💪💪💯💯💯",

I don&#39;t know why, but this man had a talent of making people smile by just existing, just showing up. Just by seeing him. When the news broke of his passing, I hoped so much that it was untrue. I was in shock to find out that it was true and it didn&#39;t only take him, but other innocent people, including his daughter. I still smile when I see him. He was such a great guy. He is missed.

It was unbelievably foggy and remained that way for most of the morning. I received a text message from my sister, asking me if it was true that Kobe died in a helicopter crash. My heart felt like it stopped, yet, I thought it was absurd. I searched online and there were ZERO reports about his death. She bartends and one of the customers who had just walked in told her he found out that his friend had just died in a helicopter crash, along with Kobe. I turned on the TV and NOTHING was on. I flipped channels frantically. Then my mom said that someone on the radio confirmed it. I kept flipping the channels and finally, one channel broke in with the news. It was like I had to see it to believe it. He was my age. I wasn&#39;t his biggest fan, but my God, I cried every day for a week. 💔",

They kept whispering about it and wondering if it was, but thinking, “What would Bill Murray be doing in a grocery store here of all places?” So they followed him for a couple of minutes and one of the two guys who were with him said, “Hey, Bill…” Then they felt sure it was him, but they still didn’t approach him because they didn’t want to bother him.<br><br>Then when I was 13, I was out with a friend and when I got home my parents said another friend called. I didn’t call her back because I was tired and I knew I would see her on the school bus the next day. So I got on the school bus the next morning and sat with her, and I apologized for not calling her back and that’s when she told me I missed my opportunity to meet Tom Cruise who stayed in the hotel her mom managed that night, literally half a mile from my house. 🤦‍♀️",

        "Comment":"As I rapidly near my 40s, I want to share an impact Conan O&#39;Brien had on my life and my mental health. I was born from first-generation immigrant parents. My parents struggled to make ends meet, gain proper citizenship, follow the letter of the law to a tee, and of course fight to put me through the &#39;best&#39; public schooling taxes could buy, in a privileged, somewhat gated community. Back when I was in high-school, my humanities teacher made some reference to Conan O&#39;Brien during her lesson. Being a somewhat novice to late night American television culture (and let me remind you kids, this was in the days before smartphones and Google even existed), back then I innocently raised my hand and asked who Conan O&#39;Brien was. My teacher gave me one cynical look, and immediately ordered the student sitting behind me to smack me on the back of the head with their notebook. Next thing I know, I felt the back of my head make swift, stinging contact with the student&#39;s aluminum spiral binded 100 page notebook, while I felt all the heavily disapproving stares and comments from all the rest of the 22 or so students in my class who likely assumed I was culturally inept to belong in their country, let alone community. In hindsight it sounds ridiculous now but, back then I really believed I had committed a grave sin worthy of discipline low-key reminiscent to a teacher in a dictatorship disciplining me for not immediately acknowledging or respecting a reference to the current leader.<br><br>All this to say, after watching this video, it finally dawned on me why my teacher acted in the manner she did that day. I had simply not recognized a such a great Late Night Talk Show legend in the making; Conan O&#39;Brien, my sincerest apologies to you 🙇‍♂️🙏 may you live a long and healthy blessed life.❤",

However, back in the 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s having late night comdey is all we had. SNL was a huge part of it all with second city and more.<br>I never liked Leno. Leno wasn&#39;t funny at all. Letterman had moments, but as an adult back then people were pretty desperate for some comic relief.<br>Plus your TV would shut off still after national anthem. Or it would shut off and go static.<br>Leno has no stage presence and is not funny. He&#39;s a jerk and always has been a Jerk with no wit, not even great to look at. Leno had absolutely no care about being funny and the whole art of it. Leno should&#39;ve been fired for being so bad and being a Jerk. He can&#39;t even talk right.<br>Letterman was hit or miss. Before all the crap came out.<br>However, He is a Groos weasel who couldn&#39;t behave right either.<br>I would like to say thank You 🙏 for Conan O&#39;Brien for being the TRUE KING OF THE LATE NIGHT SHOW!!!<br>Also, huge thank you to all staff writers for SNL too.

Wow he looks like his dad so so much. <br>Hold on just one minute guys while I scan the audience {{{ me looking at the audience with binoculars making sure Wolfgang Van Halen isnt here to remind me that &quot;its genetics ...go figure &quot; }}}<br>Ok...the coast is clear. Anyway, IMHO, Robert is a comfort for all the fans of the Crocodile Hunter himself ...Steve Irwin.  September 4, 2023 marks the 19 years since Steve was killed. It absolutely broke my heart knowing that <br> people were INTENTIONALLY hunting down, catching and killing any and all Sting Rays they could find all in the name of VENGEANCE !!!!  The man who accompanied Steve that day even said it was Steves fault. If Steve had survived he would take full responsibility, and knowing that people were purposely killing these beautiful sea creatures would have absolutely upset Steve so very much. RIP STEVE IRWIN !!! ❤ YOU ARE LOVED AND MISSED SO VERY ❤❤❤❤❤MUCH !!!!!",

Of course theyd see that as a betrayal! They help this guy win one or two crucial states to get elected and now JFK&#39;S little brother is coming after them? 😆 I dont think it was just the Mob who assassinated JFK either. I do believe that our own government was also involved from Lyndon Johnson down to George Bush Sr. to Woody Harrelsons dad. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised the American people bought that dumbass story about Oswald being the shooter, as well as the Warren Commission Report. Let&#39;s use some common sense here people. Jack Ruby himself had a gambling problem and\/or was skimming from the Mob owned restaurant\/nightclub he was running to cover his debts and was into the big guys for a fair amount of money. My speculation here is it was put to him that either he take care of Oswald or his ass was going into the nearest swamp in Louisiana, never to be heard from again.",

I call this your shadow work or dark night of the soul. We’re in a spiritual war now as I’m sure you’ve known this for a long time. Please please start doing your life path work !!! It’s the most important thing we all need to be doing. Everyone is needed now to share and spread their light. I’m an intuitive empath and I see what’s in the shadows. It’s a consciousness that humanity has created and those before us. It’s not pretty at all. Everyone needs to work on themselves to heal and I see now that this is part of your healing. I might have been a little rough on you in another comment on first part of this story. I see the light in you and I see the shadows. We all have them including myself. Healing our own soul of the dark is healing everyone also. Praying for all on our planet. Especially the controllers. 🙏🏼💕🌎🐛🦋",

Superman (easy winner. What he did to that one dude with his beam that shut off his abilities forever, was crazy powerful.)<br>2. Ronnie (his beam doesn&#39;t just cut it disintegrates, then he destroyed the planet) <br>3. Homelander (its like an eye lightsaber it cuts fast but it is not as strong power wise. eg how long it took for his beams to murder the first ceo in the show)<br><br>Not included in the top 3 list are: <br>Cyclops (due to his mutant ability his eyes are actually doorways to a domain of power, he is disqualified)<br>Darkseid (due to him actually being a living concept, he is disqualified)<br>Ikaris (due to him just being bad at it, he is disqualified)<br>Jack Jack (due to insufficient information and age, his powers may grow or, (because he has 23 powers) they may stay at the level they currently are because of power balance.) <br>Thanos (lack of use)<br>Captain Marvel (lack of use)<br>Starfire (many different opinions due to multiple versions of character)<br><br>I look forward to any discussions. 🙂",

I hope you keep doing your thing 🤘🔥💗<br>I wish Chester Bennington had had this aggression on the outside, but his was directed inward, at himself. When his last album was ripped up, he was booed and even had objects thrown at him on stage, he no longer had the strength to fight it , instead turning all his anger about it on himself and ending his life. All you damn haters have him on your conscience, you are trash and will hopefully be punished by higher authorities.<br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=%23fallinginrevers\">#fallinginrevers<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=%23ronnieradke\">#ronnieradke<\/a><br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=%23chesterbennington\">#chesterbennington<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=%23linkinpark\">#linkinpark<\/a>",

NOT EVERYONE TRUELY DESIRES IT, AND MOST THAT DO DESIRE THE TRUTH OF GOD, ONLY DESIRE TO USE IT FOR CONTROL AND TO TRY TO USE IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE, BECAUSE THEY COULD ACTUALLY CARE LESS, DUE TO THEIR HEARTS BEING FOR THIS WORLD AND THE THINGS IN IT. THIS IS THE REPROBATION THAY OVERCOMES THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO PERSISTENTLY LIVE WITH HIDDEN MOTIVES AND SELFISH AGENDAS THINKING THEY ARE ENTITLED TO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND IF THEY DONT GET WHAT THEY WANT, THEY THROW A GROWN ADULT TANTRUM. SO MANY PEOPLE, OPENLY DO ALL TYPES OF PAGAN THINGS, AND IT IS BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY HAVE MORE OF A UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE THINGS THEN THEY EVER DID GOD, AS THEY FELT GOD IGNORED THEM OR JUST DIDNT CARE. I USED TO THINK GOD IGNORED ME TOO. UNTIL I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND HOW ALL I EVER SAID TO HIM WAS &quot;PLEASE GIVE ME A SIGN&quot;, NOT TO MENTION WHAT I SAID TO HIM WHEN I BLAMED HIM FOR MY PROBLEMS LIKE A BRAINDEAD CORNY FOOL. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND HOW WE ARE TOLD THAT ALL FLESH IS 100% EVIL, THAT THERE IS NO ONE GOOD ON THE EARTH, NO, NOT ONE, AND HOW IF I WAS GOD, HOW I WOULD FEEL IF THOSE I LOVE DEARLY ONLY HAD A &quot;PLEASE GIVE ME A SIGN&quot; TO SAY TO ME, AND HOW I COULD CLEARLY SEE THEIR HEARTS DESIRE AND HIDDEN INTENT, AND HOW SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SO EVIL AND IN THE WRONG AND HAVE BETRAYED GOD SO BAD, AND BLAMED HIM FOR THEIR PROBLEMS AS IF HES SUPPOSED TO STOP ALL EXSISTANCE AND BREAK HIS PROMISE OF US ALL HAVUNG FREE WILL JUST TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS, AS IF GOD IS ONLY THERE TO SERVE YOU, AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, AS IF GOD OWES YOU SOMETHING, AS IF HE HASNT ALREADY GIVEN YOU THE EARTH, THE SEA, THE SUN THE MOON AND THE STARS, AND THE VERY LIFE YOU HAVE AND BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS, BUT BC THINGS GO WRONG OR PEOPLE USE THEIR OWN FREE WILL TO DO HORRIBLE THINGS ITS APPARENTLY HIS FAULT, WHEN WE ARE TOLD THAT GOD LOVES ALL OF US SO MUCH, THAT IT IS FAR BEYOND THE ABILITY TO EVER UNDERSTAND....SO THIS MEANS EVEN THOSE WHO WRONG US OR OTHERS, GOD IS ALSO WAITING FOR THEM AND GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS AND BELIEFS AND TURN TO HIM AND FINALLY BE ALIVE ENTIRELY AND BELIEVE IN HIS SON JESUS CHRIST AND REPENT AND CHANGE THEIR MIND ABOUT LIFE AND BEING HORRIBLE TO OTHERS, BECAUSE GOD LOVES ALL OF US AND WANTS US ALL TO HAVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE, HE ISNT GOING TO DROP EVERYTHING TO SOLVE JUST ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS, NOT TO MENTION WE ARE LITERALLY PROMISED TO BE PROTECTED AND PROVIDED FOR BY GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRIST AND THE AUTHORITY HE HAS AND THE AUTHORITY HE ALSO GAVE US, AND SIMPLY BELIEVEING 100% THAT HE WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOURS AS YOU BELIEVE IN HIS ABILITY TO FULLY DO THAT, AND YOU KNOW N.O.T.H.I.N.G. IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD AND NOTHING IS TOO HARD FOR HIM TO DO. NOT TO MENTION, THE YOKE OF FOLLOWING JESUS IS EASY AND HIS BURDEN IS LIGHT, BECAUSE GOD MAY HAVE GIVEN US FREE WILL, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SAVEING OUR LIVES, HE DID EVERY SINGLE THING HIMSELF THROUGH JESUS CHRIST AND SEALED US ALL THE FREE GIFT OF SALVATION ETERNALLY AS JESUS TOOK OUR PLACE ON THE CROSS AND TOOK THE PUNISHMENT FOR OUR SINS UPON HIMSELF BECAUSE ONLY HE IS HOLY AND CLEAN AND PURE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE DEBT OF THE SINS OF ALL MANKIND PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE, AND HE HAS DEFEATED DEATH, THE GRAVE, AND THE DRAGON, AND HAS WON YOU AND ALL OF US, THE WAY BACK HOME FOR SURE 100%, AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE IN HIM AND LOVE GOD WITH YOUR WHOLE HEART AND SPIRIT AND SOUL. WHEN YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT ALL THIS, AND REALISE GOD IS NOT LIMITED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE HIM SEEM LIKE TO YOU, AND THAT YOUR PERCEPTION CAN ALSO BE WRONG SOMETIMES, THEN YOU CAN KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO FINALLY KNOW GOD AS HE TRUELY IS, IS ACTUALLY VERBALLY SPEAK TO GOD IN A PRIVATE PLACE SO YOU NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT BEING JUDGED, AND TO ASK TO WITNESS AND ENCOUNTER THE TRUTH COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED BY MAN, UNTOUCHED BY LIES, UNTOUCHED BY ANYTHING THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY FROM THE FATHER OF TRUTH, THE ONE TRUE GOD OF ALL EXSISTANCE, THE LORD OF THE HIGHEST WHITEST BRIGHTEST PUREST LIGHT GROUNDED IN PURE LOVE AND PURE TRUTH, SO YOU NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO EVER WONDER AND YOU NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO PLACE YOUR FAITH IN MANKIND TO EVER DELIVER IT TO YOU KNOWING THEY WONT. THIS ENTIRE REALITY IS MASKED BY TOO MANY MISREPRESENTED VERSIONS OF GOD AND PEOPLE THINKING THATS HIM, NOT EVEN GIVING HIM THE RIGHT TO SHOW THEM WHO HE TRUELY IS, BECAUSE THEY DIDNT CARE ABOUT HIM AT ALL TO EVEN CONSIDER SEEKING IT, WHICH IS WHY THEY END UP IN REPROBATION, UNDER THE GREAT DECEPTION OF THEIR OWN NARCISSISTIC SOULS.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t care what anyone says, but I found out God is very real just by being honest and respectful. It seems alot of us are too self absorbed to do this. The truth is free. But only those who truely desire it with their heart and not their evils will find it",

        "Comment":"When I met God, I had a vision of a outline of a man playing the guitar in the clouds surrounded by flashing lightning followed by rumbles of thunder and the man I only saw his outline but he was flashing silvery rainbow rapidly and he had long hair, and was headbanging and his hair was makeing a brutal circle going round and round just getting into it, and shredding the fuck out of the entire atmosphere. I&#39;ll never forget that. The guitar in this, gives me the feeling that vision did. And yes, I was sober. Yes, this shit is real, and it all depends on how real you are with yourself and God, respectfully and lovingly and cautious of your urge to ask for a sign, when really you need to tell him how you feel about him and if he&#39;s real you just want the truth directly from him, And that you&#39;re not demanding it or testing him, But you just want the truth. If that&#39;s the truth then you will see what happens next. If you have hidden motives, Think again. God knows how this one ends 🤟",

[22] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. [23] For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. [24] Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. [25] Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; [26] that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, [27] that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. [28] So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. [29] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: [30] for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. [31] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. [32] This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. [33] Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.<br><br>🎉‭Philippians‬ ‭2:1‭-‬11‬ ‭NIV‬\r<br>[1] Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, [2] then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. [3] Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, [4] not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. [5] In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: [6] Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; [7] rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. [8] And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross! [9] Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, [10] that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, [11] and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br><br>🎉I Love you Jesus Loves you God Bless in Jesus&#39; Mighty Name<br><br>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.<br>John 3:14‭-‬21 KJV<br>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works&#39; sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<br>John 14:11‭-‬18 KJV<br>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br>Ephesians 6:10‭-‬13 KJV",

        "Comment":"This video brought back some good memories. This one time a buddy and neighbor of mine who is a retired NAVY SEAL needed some extra money. So he was given a US government assassination project in Bosnia. He was really excited about it. So one night he came over like a kid on Christmas to show me his new specs before being deployed. He had a new silencer and a red laser toy for his pistol. I let him in and he said, &quot;Check this out!&quot; He screwed the silencer into the barrel and turned out the lights. He put a bead around the room before putting it right between my eyes then over to my then future first ex wife. He and I started laughing and I told him, &quot;Hell yeah man that&#39;s freaking cool!&quot; She freaked out and started screaming. lol So we had to calm her down before he left. The next morning two FBI agents showed up at my door asking if I know this guy and about him buying a silencer and laser specs. I said, &quot;Yeah. He&#39;s a friend and neighbor of mine who bought those specs legally in part of an assassination project in Bosnia he is about to leave for. He&#39;s a good guy go talk to him.&quot; Those agents just stared at me a moment. Then looked at each other then back at me. Then said, &quot;Oh. Well, we just wanted to make sure you are comfortable with that information. Do you feel safe?&quot; I said yes. So they went to talk to him. Later that day he came over to my place looking pissed and said, &quot;Did you talk to the FBI about me?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah of course I did man!&quot; He asked what I told them and I replied. He stared at me for a tic then said, &quot;Oh my God thank you bro!&quot; Then gave me one those gross sweaty man hugs. Afterwards we threw a party for him at my bosses house who was in Air America for the CIA to send him off. Which ironically one my female coworkers who was drunk off her ass called me an asshole for no reason, other than my then girlfriend was a twat. Long story short, he completed his mission and came home safely. Haven&#39;t seen any of those people since. Aside from when I had to go to work for the DoD a short time after. Dude in the video looks just like him. Funny ole world isn&#39;t it? He is a big ole marshmallow truthfully. A titty baby. I tried to invite the FBI agents inside to chill but they weren&#39;t interested in all of that though. I got banned from Tik Tok and Facebook for talking about these things. Or maybe it was me admitting my ex girlfriend in the FBI after all this transpired is so freaking hot you can&#39;t put a ring or declaration of love to her. 💙 Without her breaking your heart, sons. She loves you more than you know. 💛 Don&#39;t spook her off! Because she isn&#39;t a ghost or an asshole. She is a government watch dawg for the FBI. Don&#39;t eat the artichoke or put salt on your salad. Don&#39;t be a stick in the mud. Be nice. Just some advice. Take care of yourselves. <br>~ Love Dad<br><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/y80Pc4u9YEw\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/y80Pc4u9YEw<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/zLlbzlS6_Lk\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/zLlbzlS6_Lk<\/a>",

So she knows from a young age what her father does and why he has to leave her every now and then, but he will always come home to her. He knows, through his mother, what it feels like to be abandoned and he doesn&#39;t want his daughter to ever have to feel that. He assures her that no matter where he is, he is always with her and will never leave her. Many fathers did not have this opportunity and had to leave their beloved children behind. My older daughter is one of those kids and I wish he would come home to her every damn day. I want the song for my funeral because my death is a “coming home” for me. Simply a beautiful song 🖤🎶",

Ummm....no. 😅 <br><br>They&#39;ve kept proving without a doubt that they are completely cliche in every possible way because they&#39;ve brought absolutely NOTHING new to this genre ever. They totally ripped off and used nearly word-for-word some of the lyrics from Ozzy Osbourne&#39;s &#39;Crazy Train,&#39; K-C and JoJo&#39;s &#39;All My Life,&#39; and other bands that I won&#39;t waste my time pointing out, just in this one song alone.<br><br>If you watch this video entitled &#39;Engine 45,&#39; you will see a wolf running in the snow that decides to suddenly catch major air by jumping for seemingly no reason whatsoever 😂, and then tries to look all badass by circling a bloody dagger that&#39;s sticking out of concrete blocks. That stupidity ends about 25% of the way through the video, and then the remaining 75% is redundant stupidity showing this wolf licking the dagger over and over and over until the end of the video. 🤣🤣🤣<br><br>You&#39;d think that collectively any 5 band members could come up with a video of something (literally anything!?!) that lasts more than a quarter of the video, and would actually make any sense whatsoever so as to match up in some way to the title and lyrics of &#39;Engine 45.&#39;<br><br>If you happen to be into metalcore, I promise you there are literally hundreds of bands that are much more talented instrumentally, lyrically and in every other way, than this band of chump-change musicians. I would move right along here, folks, there&#39;s literally nothing to see here at all. 😄<br><br>As stated by The Ghost Inside, they&#39;re a little bit like Unearth and As I Lay Dying, with a little less guitar solos and a little less singing...yet they have two guitarists that cannot play a guitar solo to save their lives (despite listing one of the guitarists as the &quot;lead&quot; guitarist 🙄), have a singer who is not fit to even hold the dirty jockstraps of the singers in Unearth and AILD and have a complete lack of powerful or intelligent riffs beyond power chords. It is blatantly clear, however, that they chose to name drop by throwing both of those band&#39;s names out there, so that people might think The Ghost Inside could be awesome...until the moment a person invests 30 seconds of their life listening to a song by them...and then realizes they got completely duped. 💁🏼‍♀️",

        "Comment":"I feel like you couldve done better with that $40. That $8 monorail was unnecessary if youre going on a budget. Im from LA, so not a Nevada resident. There was a day where i was by myself and i did something similar to this because i didnt want to gamble. Spent time with one group of friends from Sunday to Wednesday, then they left on Thursday and i was by myself since my other group of friends were coming from Friday to Sunday. I booked my complimentary two nights for wed night and thursday night since most comp nights are available from sunday to thursday. So i spent entire Thursday by myself and ive tried something similar. I stayed at the Orleans but their shuttles are free to everyone and it connects u from Orleans all the way to the Strip near Harrahs and also to Downtown Vegas near Fremont. I took full advantage of this. So not a single penny on transportation. I did cheat because i put Grey Goose in my large flask. But there are places i drank such as Stage Door Casino where its only $1 beer, $2 patron shots. Ate at Blondie&#39;s for brunch for $7($5 + tax + tip), Ellis Island for dinner for $13($9.99 steak special + tax + tip). Walked around entire strip. There&#39;s also a small spot i forgot what it was called but ate a slice of pizza in the middle for $3.(pizza sucked. I dont recommend it. Wish i knew the name of the place so i can tell people not to go there.) I checked out nearly every casino and signed up for player&#39;s card and came with free play $10-$25 and thats the only way i gambled. Bought a Vegas shotglass for $5. While gambling using free play money, i got myself bunch of free drinks plus tip(each drink and i spent $10 on tips, so over 10 drinks). <br>$7 Blondies for brunch<br>$13 Ellis Island steak special<br>$5 stage door casino(1 shot patron, 1 beer + $2 tip)<br>$5 souvenir shotglass<br>$10 tips for drinks while playing games<br>$3 nasty pizza<br>Total: $43<br>Of course, i had a large 8oz flask of Grey Goose. So that helped a lot to make sure im wasted. 😁",

Place some of the bread on your little plate.<br>3. Tear off a bite size piece of your bread on your plate.<br>4. Butter just that little piece, using the butter on your little plate. <br>5. Put the entire bite-sized piece into your mouth. <br>Doing it this way saves you from gnawing awkwardly on a loaf of baguette. 😉",

Also I did go there on opening night I missed Cher,but I heard people talking about her walking by and we also got a hand pay for 1,208 which is not good ,but at least we won money and now we have to pay taxes on it and it took the lady 2 1\/2 hours to pay us we didn&#39;t even get home till 4:30 in the morning😢 there was a man next to me betting 88 cents and he won $10,000 that&#39;s crazy !!",

Would like to get closer!<br>New York New York, Paris Hotel and Bellagio hadn’t been built. Treasure Island was being built when I left. <br>I never got lost at Ceasars Palace 🤔😁😂<br>Amazing! I never tried In-N-Out 😞It didn’t occur to me I would leave before having it. It’s like White Castle which is mostly Midwest and NY metro. Sure there are a few in NM and FL, but if you’ve never been, it’s an experience. <br><br>I mentioned this in someone else’s video so I’ll say it here too: You were very careful to say walking around with an open non-glass container\/drink is acceptable on both the Strip and Downtown\/Fremont St., but failed to differentiate that it’s still illegal everywhere else. 30 years ago you could have one in a paper bag on the streets; as long as it was somewhat hidden it was ok, which is different from most other cities where even that’s illegal. Has this changed? Please update!<br><br>The Stratosphere… Thank you for some views from the observation deck. I’m afraid of heights and couldn’t get near the windows. I was actually experiencing a little vertigo just watching the video..<br><br>Downtown\/Old Town: originally the overhang wasn’t an LED screen, I have to see it now. They talked about putting in canals on the side streets back then, since you didn’t mention them I take it that never happened??<br><br>Area15 looks interesting. <br><br>Thanks for another great video.., I’m slowly working through them all. You mentioned watching them several times in another vid, I can do this but I was under the impression YouTube only pays on unique views. Am I wrong? If you get paid, I’ll watch them all 100 times!!

You&#39;re a star and you&#39;ll do just fine no matter what you do 👍🙏💕🙂<br>You&#39;re a trail blazer and I admire you for that and would like to see more of you and Lydia in your natural environment, which is pretty much anywhere... Oh, and I like Kevin, too, but regardless, your dating videos are fun, too.",

If you’re playing slot machines, try betting on the horses or playing a football game stop with the food with the influencers you can go to a Buffay and get out of it and enjoy gambling. It should be free if you’re gambling, these people don’t know nothing about gambling they have a sizzler appetite.

I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2020 because the market outburst in December 2020 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2020 it didn&#39;t work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.<br>I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform.<br>Here is his contact via <br>Email Address:Ronsonbaylor @gmail .com<br>Tele gram: @Expert_Baylorfx<br>WhatsApp: ☎️+ 1 5 0 9 3 4 2 7 0 7 7...",

Voter fraud lies is the fastest acid test of which politicians are LIARS. <br><br>I rewatched just to enjoy Biden&#39;s win again. Smartmatic should get $2.7 million more from Fox for their blatent election lies. This country is much better off in Biden and Democrat hands. The media and especially the news is the 1% who don&#39;t want to be taxed or have their power curtailed. Hopefully Trump will finally be in jail for trying to overturn the 2024 election. How much did it cost us in recounts and court cases because his ego was too fragile to admit he lost? I hope they strip him of every dime he has to reimburse the taxpayers. Happy 2024! Let&#39;s make sure the 147 Republicans who refused to certify Biden&#39;s win go down, too. We&#39;d have 100% better government overnight. 😊",

I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can’t even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn’t even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren’t for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn’t have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what’s really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I’ll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times.

He tried his level best to cater to the needs of people, put forth his policies and fought passionately- but in the end the main stream media and the democratic establishment played their crooked roles, indoctrinated people with fear of different kinds and stole from the most well deserved presidential candidate his so imminent nomination. So ironic that it is happening in These United States of America- can’t fathom this!😢😢😢",

He&#39;s the type of dude to rob a bank and give the bank back some money and want to be praised as the hero - never seen such corruption - I mean this dude is a hurricane a one man wrecking crew of corruption - a crime wave - by himself - one man crime spree - how can anyone not see that he&#39;s the biggest criminal ever born ! I mean seriously there wasn&#39;t a bigger criminal ever born in this entire world - ahh nope hands down the biggest most obnoxious criminal ever born - I just can&#39;t believe that anyone would allow this madness to continue - first if all he can&#39;t run the local Starbucks - for real everything he touches goes poorly and that&#39;s an understatement - it dies or breaks - never works - none of his policies have ever worked - he breaks the law on an hourly basis - how many times a day does Ronny break the law ? Double digits - Ronny they are talking about the bone spurs - remember five six times saying the spurs were broken ? Unspeakable - this is mind blowing - I&#39;d rather trust Declan running the country ! Office of the national security is trying to do closed door public threat for congress so American citizens don&#39;t know Nathan ? Walks are closing in ! Be careful William - gonna screw around and end up getting ten years in federal prison with a conspiracy charge - by the way no heresy with a co- conspiracy charge - just keep that in mind when the RICO ACT gets charged and ten of you all get whacked with a conspiracy charge ! Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you ! Your breaking the law and the documents say it and lev and Gordon and the witnesses - even the government accountability office says your breaking the law ! Let&#39;s say that again your breaking a federal law by the OMB office not giving the money to Ukraine you broke the law ! I agree exactly with the black peoples - you white bread are out of your minds ! Going down with the ship the titanic is sinking you are on the ship headed down quickly - could have gotten a rescue little ship - a life jacket - gonna end up like jack - sinking to the bottom of the ocean - drowning - freezing to death and remaining on the bottom of the ocean - it&#39;s a cold dark lonely experience ! Sure you want to end up like Paul or Cohen or Flynn  or Roger or Lev or Gates ? Etc etc etc are where your headed ? It&#39;s not rocket science to see how this is going to end up eventually - got no chance whatsoever of getting away with Nathan - all those emails and documents are coming out one way or another ! Just thought there was smarter people involved that could have ended this at any time and gotten the best results ? Now I know your not getting out of prison !",

        "Comment":"I can say now that I&#39;m grown and that I hid from the things this little girl is so strong to stand up to. As a kid I also saw people and much scarier things that shouldn&#39;t bleed thru to our world. After years of torture and being harassed by shadow people, one specifically I called the rubber man, he was blacker than black and shiny, and also a 2ft troll of some kind that my mother also saw. We didn&#39;t tell each other for 6 months. Things would jump on our beds and growl in our faces. Our piano would play at random times after my husband brought home a brief case from a garage sale. I know some ghosts need help, but I wasn&#39;t in a place to do that and I think that&#39;s why I attracted the nastiest of the paranormal. These children are so intelligent and kind and strong, the support they have is amazing. One of my friends was upset because I saw her dad walk thru a room, I didn&#39;t know what to say? We were close so I just explained what I saw with as much detail as I could. She pulls out a picture and he&#39;s wearing the same black and white flannel I just described. She had been trying to see him for a few years and couldn&#39;t understand why it didn&#39;t happen for her but it did for me. We decided to go to a spiritual camp in Florida for the weekend so she could speak with a psychic. This camp had Dr&#39;s with their PHD&#39;s from all over the world who come and study for months. Sorry this is long but there&#39;s a point lol. Immediately getting there I wasn&#39;t feeling well, when I opened the door to our room I saw a woman for 1 sec but I described her by detail, brown hair in a bun, delicate features, high lace collar dress with a ribbon in her hair, I gasped a second 😂 when I saw her I am always thrown off even tho I see it everyday! So  that night we were supposed to go on a small walk to where the lay lines are located basically I guess it&#39;s easier to reach the other side. Sort of like a portal I&#39;m assuming? But before that we went on a walk and I smelled the most awful smell as an animal must have died... She didn&#39;t smell it and I knew because it&#39;s happened before, I knew it was bad. Finally night comes for our walk to the area where we should see orbs, and to my surprise I saw 2 nobody else saw. I wasn&#39;t feeling well so I told my friend to enjoy herself and I walked up to sit outside at a table by the restaurant. I saw a woman across the area and she asked to join me 😊 well of course!!! But the next thing out of her mouth shook me, do you know you are a very powerful psychic? I just froze lol... I mentioned we were there to learn about her dad but I&#39;ve pretty much known something was going on with me. My entire life has been this way and now I&#39;m facing it straight on. I said what does that mean exactly. She explained she has psychic abilities but I have all the abilities and most have one. This was me 😳 years I&#39;ve known all my life, I know when celebrities are going to pass which is awful to say but I see it in my mind and it happens. Mentioning this to my friends is a buzz kill but I mean you try being me. I was then told by this person that she has never seen so many dead people around one psychic. 30, there were 30. I was then later stopped by one of the DRs the next day as she was passing by and she asked if we could talk a min. Again, of course! I have to tell you I&#39;ve never seen someone with 3 spirit guides. She named one of these spirit guides and my mouth dropped. When I was born I was covered completely in a white veil and if you know native American history this means something. My mom took me to a shaman to see what this meant because we have family who still live on reservations. He explained to her what it meant, gave me a blessing and I learned all this when I was a teenager. When she said the name of my spirit guide, same name as the shaman!! Deango, I know I&#39;m spelling it all wrong. But my mom could not believe they knew the name. So this DR. Then tells me I have many abilities and she would like to teach me how to live with this and how to use it. She said I have the ability to see people for one second but I see them in my mind in full detail, I know things before they happen, I have the ability somehow to think of something and it will happen but in the way say I&#39;m thinking man I wish I had some iced tea and my husband comes home with it? This is a daily occurrence so am I the problem or are we just linking up I have no idea 😂😂 she said I know past things I shouldn&#39;t know, I can see things from other dimensions, like the shadow people and the troll. How did she know all this? She was running a class every Wednesday night and basically wanted me to be the main event 😳 still not sure about all that but I&#39;m getting better at accepting it. I lived an hour away so there was no way for me to commit to every Wednesday but the time I spent there was very educational. Learning to use my abilities the way these beautiful children do ❤ sorry it&#39;s a long one 😬",

They do it all the time. It wont hurt anyone. You can make a billion dollars and give it to us and we be good. I know people will say no that will make rhe value of the dollar worthless if they do that. Bruh, if they make the money and dont tell anyone they did. Then its all good.

My home is all I have for my stable of mind. My husband has everything on him as far as working cause I&#39;ve not been able to work cause of I&#39;ve only been in customer service and health care and I&#39;m scared of it now cause of trying not to be sick so I can take care of my family.

I’m pretty much his only good friend who wanted to get to know him. he complains to me about how heartbroken he is.. i try to give him advice to get over me, but he won’t listen. He knows i’ll never like him be side im a lesbian. we made a promise that if one of us self harms, the other will have to do it too. And he has broken that promise and i’m trying to get over self harm and i keep having to self harm…because i blame myself for his problems.. i used to like him 4 years ago, but he keeps saying he will kill himself so randomly, and it hurts… a lot. i tried to force myself to like him but it’s just impossible because i’m a lesbian.. i feel so bad. today he said he wanted to to something risky that could ruin something.. i knew he wanted to kiss me before he went on  vacation. i feel so bad and i think if he kissed me then he might feel better and get over me.. but this is my FIRST KISS i’m talking about… i- don’t want him to me my first kiss.. i don’t know.. i’m scared. he told me that he wanted to kiss me but i already knew because i can see through people super super easily….. got any suggestions yall? 😞",

I wish the average white American could name the exact place and time when their ancestors became “white.” Willingly traded in their European ethnicity for whiteness. And I wish that went deeper than just the mind. I wish it could be embodied in how you guys live everyday, pray, self actualize and stand in solidarity with the latest Other. 🙏🏾",

As everyone noticed, all the other balls just clumped together at the bottom of the &#39;well&#39;, which is not what occurs ! Space is actually four dimensional, time representing movement. Visualize space as a medium instead of a flat fabric, which gets more dense the more mass forms, time also slows down near more mass, and seems to speed up for less massive objects in more spread out space ? I guess because it&#39;s hard to visualize and describe with words, physicists invented symbols with which to write formulas.🤨😁",

If i were to look at the big ben and parliament from the opposite side of Westminster, to being with, the big ben and parliament would be on the left, not right.<br>Sono considered &quot;maybe this image is flipped?&quot; But it still did not make sense for how it would look from the south bank and that&#39;s when I realised the building next to the big ben are actually the other side of the bridge. Follow me: it means that flr how the buildings are placed the bridge should actually be going from right to left, not from top to bottom of this image. I lived in londong for a decade so my best guess is: the background of the picture with the big ben and buildings is actually shown from the perspective of the pedestrian bridge next to Charing cross railway bridge. And the &quot;bridge&quot; we see coming towards us that poses as Westminster bridge Is actually just a random bridge (also because Westminster bridge does not have a rail to divide the pavement from the road). This was interesting but yeah, if you feel like experiencing the feeling of London and then visit and can&#39;t find this place it&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t exists like this 😅",

Then they carve it into steaks and sell it as wagyu. The USDA does not have a standard for wagyu beef. In real wagyu the fat is intermuscular meaning within the meat. Wagyu must be at least 55% intermuscular fat. Sorry dude, you were scammed 😂😂😂😂 I&#39;ve been a chef for over 40 years and I have seen this in high-end restaurants.

If I want a ramen egg, 6 minutes, and finally, if I’m having a salad, I would cook it for 7-8 minutes.<br><br>I’m probably the only person that has soft boiled eggs in my salad, but I hate hard boiled eggs unless they’re deviled. Even then, only my mom can make them the way I can eat them.<br><br>Think of the semi runny yolk as an additive to your other dressing! And if you don’t use dressing, the flavor of salted egg yolks adds a nice flavor to my crunchy greens ❤",

Mosty the cheese needs to get better. <br>Some taste great like vegan greek cheese and Feta cheese and nut cheeses witch taste different but are very tasty still.<br>But some taste very bad like Gouda and Mozzarella cheese and other that taste to plane. To be fare they taste quite plane from cow milk aswell. But mostly it is the the consistency of many cheeses needs to get improved opon.<br>I mostly want a good vegan &quot;Prästost&quot;, a swedish\/Scandinavian kind of cheese witch was my favourites. Takes a while to ferment and is packed with flavour and a tasty flakey conistancy, Deelicious😋<br>Hopefully some day ill discover one on the shelf and try it😄.<br>But have yall tried &quot;Prästost&quot;?
