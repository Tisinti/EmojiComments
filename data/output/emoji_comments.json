    "322": "You guys who are leaving rude comments obviously have never lived in Korea. There plastic surgery or getting any sort of alterations done to your face or body is basically almost encouraged? Don’t blame others for promoting something that’s deemed as normal? She never said “forehead wrinkles are ugly and you all should go get forehead Botox just because I did” like.. I’m literally 17 years old and I promise you I’m insecure about just about everything that has to do with my body but I’m not sitting here like “omg wow I should do that too 😰” do you people think us teenagers are really influenced that easily by every single thing we see? 💀",

    "334": "You Kinda got this for no reason 🥲",
    "335": "kinda messed up tbh, do people that do botox even know what it is? is it not scary to inject a literal paralyzing toxin into your face? not the “essential oil will get rid of it” toxin, a literal toxin produced by bacteria that offs people. “omw to get some more botox🤪🤪🤪” gives me funky energy",
    "336": "y’all let her be 😭 the amount of toxicity here is baffling. just because u like things 100% organic and natural like a baby’s butt doesn’t mean other people can’t do stuff they want. if you’re so natural then don’t use skincare. just wash ur face with water and be done with it. there’s nothing wrong with doing what we want, especially in terms of aesthetics and beauty, as what she did doesn’t look destructive at all to me.<br><br>everyone’s standard is also different. u feel like forehead wrinkles and stuff is normal then it’s ok, u feel like acnes are normal then it’s ok too, but i don’t think it’s your place to judge others who feel otherwise and try to do the efforts to fix it?<br><br>edit: you can’t blame the internet or the content creators for “influencing” people to do stuff. you’re the one consuming the internet, and it’s your own responsibility to filter what’s right and what’s not. this is why education at home is important, so don’t blame others for “influencing” kids or others because you’re the one consuming the content 😭 i only watch this for entertainment, and good for her for taking care of herself, but would i do the same thing myself? i might be or i might not be, but it’ll be my own choice, not influenced by her.",

I have no opinion about Kelly Ripa one way or another but it infuriates me when people jump to conclusions, especially about a person&#39;s character, without &quot;researching&quot; for themselves first. It&#39;s her experience and her story to tell and only she and Regis (and maybe Gelman and Art Moore) really know what went on. And while not relevant to this specific conversation about KR&#39;s book, what&#39;s even scarier is that you&#39;re the kind of people who vote based on sound bites and TV commercials instead of finding out what candidates really represent.

Their culture-wide commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people. Real estate values are fueled by the mix of African Americans into an area due to the caring and respectful nature of their communities, all of which are shining examples of their achievements garnered through enthusiasm for self-improvement and hard work combined with their joyful, self-reliant can-do spirits. Without their industrious and creative drive, their edified and kind natures, the shining obvious example of their culture wide ethos, their stunning ability to police themselves and raise their children to be educated adults and people of substance, importance and inherent worth, we would most undoubtedly be poorer as a nation and a city.💪💪💪💯💯💯",

    "1812": "Why YouTube recommend me this video until now😢?",
    "1813": "No tenían tanta competencia, no sacaban grupos cada 6 meses como ahora, además llenaron el vacío de 2ne1 (yg Entertainment las obligó a renunciar y desintegrar el grupo por ser &quot;gordas, prietas y feas&quot;).<br>🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️<br>YG ENTERTAINMENT:<br>Su empresa tiene varias demandas y sospechas de todo tipo, su fundador esta en la cárcel, el teddy y el dany chungs han hecho comentarios sexistas y machistas en el pasado, el ex ceo tiene antecedentes de pedofilia, drogas y lavado de dinero, varios famosos de allí ya les comprobaron drogas y cosas ilícitas y los escándalos sexuales libertinos de blackpink y su bajo rendimiento etc... Etc... Es obvio que esa empresa trata de mantenerse a flote pero yo espero que quiebre.<br>Algo podrido pudre todo lo demás, donde trabajas habla mucho de alguien.<br>ES LA MALDICIÓN DE blackpink, ELLAS ARRUINARON EL KPOP EN LA ERA MEDIOCRE DE ICE CREAM, SE CORROMPIERON.<br>✨Esos sonidos, ritmos y melodías de money, flower y solo, entre otras canciones más de blackpink ya existían, el teddy mezcla y convina ritmos ya existentes, ese teddy recicla las melodías (yo solo escucho el instrumental sintetizador de Teddy &amp; Danny Chung sin las voces playback de blackpink). La canción you &amp; me, flower y solo: Estas músicas son bonitas sin necesidad de las voces mediocres de jennie y jisoo. Cantantes como iu, twice, niziu, aespa, nmixx y etc. podrían cantarlas mucho mejor que jennie y jisoo sin problemas (todas las canciones de blackpink y sin necesidad de que canten, yo solo escucho el instrumental). Twice saco como 3 canciones diferentes de moon light antes que blackpink.<br>No entiendes. Los ritmos de blackpink son el revoltijo de varias canciones y músicas del pasado pero ni siquiera dan créditos, ni siquiera lo dicen, eso es descaro y sinismo. No dan créditos y no explican la inspiración. En cambio jyp si trata de crear melodías nuevas. Yg Entertainment ni siquiera lo intenta, todo lo recicla. Por eso suena tan bien la música de bp porque son sonidos, ritmos y melodías familiares del pasado. No es nada nuevo para el oído.<br>Lo que no saben es que teddy oppa les pone la música de fondo reciclada y mezclada de ritmos del pasado ya existentes y aparte les ayuda a que las palabras que ellas escriben rimen/escriban riman.<br>Mis padres y abuelos de más de 70 y 80 años tarareaban y cantaban canciones y melodías que se han perdido con el tiempo, porque cuando salieron no existía el Internet, ni donde guardarlas y en sus tiempos de infantes y jóvenes fueron muy populares pero hay muchas cosas y acontecimientos que se han perdido en la historia porque no quisieron darles difusión y los testigos se han ido muriendo.<br><br>En casi todas las canciones se autoafirman, se jactan y se vanaglorian (&quot;tanto tienes es lo que tanto vales&quot;, no se trata de tener más bienes y posesiones materiales para tener valor, si no de tener más dignidad, ética, moral, honor y santidad), pero los hechos dicen lo contrario, ellas son palabras no hechos y las palabras se las lleva el viento. Lo único que tienen aparte de dinero es vanagloria y la vanagloria es pasajera, si continúan enviando mensajes vanos y vacíos acabarán muy mal.<br>Sus letras son muy apáticas y antifeministas, necesitan humillar a &quot;su competencia&quot; para sentirse bien con ellas mismas. Una cosa es escuchar su música y ver sus videos y otra es obsesionarse y querer todo lo que ellas tienen o promueven. No sean ridículos como los idólatras de bp.<br>Cuando algo es pegadizo es porque solo se trata de cantar y ya, a eso se le llama comercial y mercadotecnia. Sus canciones eran pegadizas como los soundtracks de comerciales pero definitivamente les ayudo mayormente el hecho de ser embajadoras de ropas y accesorios muy bonitos.<br>Si gente rica o famosa usa algún producto los demás pobres creen y piensan que es de buena calidad y por eso comienzan a usarlo. A veces si es de buena calidad y otras veces es solo mercadotecnia. <br><br>Para mi la prostitución y la venta sexual es abominable y deberían prohibirla y el gobierno y la humanidad no deberían permitir que exista la pobreza ni las clases bajas, porque por culpa de estos pedorros pretextos y excusas existe el comercio sexual que es aborrencentemente ominoso y merece ser condenado, nunca debió existir el comercio sexual. <br>Que asco que la adultez occidental sea sinónimo de promiscuidad, que te restrieguen cuerpos ajenos en el tuyo, que los penes penetren las vaginas y las vaginas sean penetradas por diferentes penes, todo muy mal, en ese caso mejor sería que se quedarán como niños para siempre, pues de niños obedecen y están en ética y moral (pureza y dignidad, al menos la mayoría) pero si ser adulto es corromperte y llamar a lo malo bueno y a lo bueno malo, de nada aprovecha ser mayor de edad, ser adulto no significa que te corrompas y perviertas, deberían todos querer vivir hasta hacerse viejos con sabiduría, dignidad y santidad.<br>Yo no apoyo a nadie que no tenga los mismos principios y valores éticos y morales, por eso para mi es muy importante saber y conocer quienes son las personas a las que yo les consumo para no perder mi tiempo, a que dedican el tiempo libre y su vida privada, así hago con todas las empresas de cualquier tipo y cuando les descubro sus cochinadas, inmediatamente les dejo de consumir y para mi es antietico y antimoral tener varias relaciones románticas y aún más si tienen sexo con cada pareja.<br><br>✨Si no fuera porque existe la idolatría no existirían famosos, cantantes, bailarines ni ningún tipo de artista rico, millonario o multimillonario. <br>Algunos grupos tienen éxito por tanta propaganda, comerciales y colaboraciones más que por su propio talento y esfuerzo.<br>Se supone que entrenaron para cantar y bailar, se supone que esa es su vocación pero ahora muchas y muchos usan el canto y el baile para escalar a ser modelos, influencias y actores. Todo muy mal, concéntrense en ser cantantes y bailarines primero, de lo contrario mejor hubieran estudiado actuación, modelaje o diseñador de modas.<br>✨El kpop no convirtió en un logro nada, plagiaron a los negros con tonos y estilos más pasteles y menos pesados y rudos y usaron marcas prestigiosas para ayudarse mutuamente pero las marcas que ellos representan ya estaban muy posicionadas antes de que ellos fueran embajadores...<br>Y la mayoría no son artistas, solo son famosos en una industria de plástico no de música y arte.<br>Los coreanos siempre han querido igualar a los países primer mundistas europeos y de estados unidos y los han imitado en muchas áreas, formas, maneras, aspectos y sentidos. Tan solo mira sus doramas, series, películas, sus ropas, prendas, accesorios y escenarios, todo lo visual es de un occidente elitista y clasista.<br>✨Idol es ídolo, se supone que es un ejemplo a seguir, debe cumplir con estándares ideales y utópicos, políticamente correctos pero resulta que actualmente ningún ídolo es un ejemplo ético y moral perfecto a seguir.<br>El kpop es pop coreano que cantan en coreano, que combinan varios ritmos (además el pop coreano usa palabras y frases en inglés y tiene apropiación cultural) y aunque esta mujer no la consideran idola, ella es cantante y bailarina que canta en coreano como otros cantantes y bailarines del pop coreano que cantan coreano. Y repito ningún cantante y bailarín de corea del sur y del mundo en general, sin importar que género cantan y bailan es un ejemplo digno a seguir y de idolatrar. Así que esto no tiene nada que ver con que otros cantantes y bailarines coreanos besen, abracen y muestren afección física y tierna a sus fans, deberían hacerlo.<br>Con blackpink se destruye el concepto idol inicial. Ya no lo son, ahora son como los cantantes y la música en inglés de estados unidos.<br><br>✨A quien no le guste mi comentario, tienen el poder de bloquearme, así nunca me verán. No sean inmaduros y bloqueenme si no pueden ignorarme, pero, querer censurarme solo porque no les gusta mi pensar es innecesario y eso es Imposición de programación predictiva y propaganda de inclusión y lo políticamente correcto (eso fue lo que hicieron los grandes tiranos del mundo como hitler, roma y los judios con Jesús y varios dictadores). ¿Duras son mis palabras para ustedes? Ignorenme, así como yo los tengo que soportar en este planeta.<br>📖si leyeras más seguido no sería biblia. Aprende a leer, hazte ese hábito, lo que tu quieras puedes leer. Si leyeras la biblia no hubieras escrito eso, porque la biblia verdaderamente es mucho texto. Esto no es nada.<br>🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍🤍💗🤍",

    "2138": "Almost 4 years. Man like Kobe never dies. Still surreal. Still remember where I was, what I was doing when that notification suddenly popped up on my phone. Middle of the night, completely at the opposite end of the world in Bangladesh 🇧🇩. It was way past bedtime and I had a rough day. That news shook me to the last bone in my spine. Didn&#39;t have a wink of sleep. <br><br>We love our sports here in Bangladesh. Football (what you call soccer) and cricket (baseball&#39;s older cousin) rules over here. Among American sports, basketball has a niche following because it is easy to understand and the entertainment value is probably second to none. But names like Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, LeBron James resonates to everybody. These names transcend the sport they represent, heck, transcend sports itself.<br><br>Some people in life you think would always be there being the kings that they are. Kobe was one of them. Whatever he touched turned into gold. Imagine winning an Oscar a couple of years after retiring as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Imagine the talent, the sheer will a man needs to have to accomplish these sorts of things. <br><br>I still find it hard to come to terms with the fact that Kobe Bryant isn’t walking on this planet amongst us mortals. You know what though. I don&#39;t believe one second has gone by in the last four years when the name Kobe Bryant wasn’t remembered by someone at some corner of this planet. Yes man only lived till 41, but if THAT is not an accomplished life, I don&#39;t know what is.<br><br>Rest in peace Mamba. The world is a worse off place without you.",
    "2139": "I still struggle to accept he is gone 😞",
    "2140": "I&#39;m German and only knew Kobe from seeing him in one early episode of &quot;Modern Family&quot;. I was never a big sports fan, but after that episode I saw him on TV like in the news or somewhere, and whenever he appeared on the screen, I got happy. I don&#39;t know why, but this man had a talent of making people smile by just existing, just showing up. Just by seeing him. When the news broke of his passing, I hoped so much that it was untrue. I was in shock to find out that it was true and it didn&#39;t only take him, but other innocent people, including his daughter. I still smile when I see him. He was such a great guy. He is missed. And will forever be missed, loved and remembered. He&#39;s taking care of his big girl up there ❤",

    "2148": "I&#39;ll never forget that morning that he died. I live in L.A. County, walked outside to get the newspaper, and could barely see through the thickness of the fog. It was unbelievably foggy and remained that way for most of the morning. I received a text message from my sister, asking me if it was true that Kobe died in a helicopter crash. My heart felt like it stopped, yet, I thought it was absurd. I searched online and there were ZERO reports about his death. She bartends and one of the customers who had just walked in told her he found out that his friend had just died in a helicopter crash, along with Kobe. I turned on the TV and NOTHING was on. I flipped channels frantically. Then my mom said that someone on the radio confirmed it. I kept flipping the channels and finally, one channel broke in with the news. It was like I had to see it to believe it. He was my age. I wasn&#39;t his biggest fan, but my God, I cried every day for a week. 💔",

They kept whispering about it and wondering if it was, but thinking, “What would Bill Murray be doing in a grocery store here of all places?” So they followed him for a couple of minutes and one of the two guys who were with him said, “Hey, Bill…” Then they felt sure it was him, but they still didn’t approach him because they didn’t want to bother him.<br><br>Then when I was 13, I was out with a friend and when I got home my parents said another friend called. I didn’t call her back because I was tired and I knew I would see her on the school bus the next day.

My parents struggled to make ends meet, gain proper citizenship, follow the letter of the law to a tee, and of course fight to put me through the &#39;best&#39; public schooling taxes could buy, in a privileged, somewhat gated community. Back when I was in high-school, my humanities teacher made some reference to Conan O&#39;Brien during her lesson. Being a somewhat novice to late night American television culture (and let me remind you kids, this was in the days before smartphones and Google even existed), back then I innocently raised my hand and asked who Conan O&#39;Brien was. My teacher gave me one cynical look, and immediately ordered the student sitting behind me to smack me on the back of the head with their notebook. Next thing I know, I felt the back of my head make swift, stinging contact with the student&#39;s aluminum spiral binded 100 page notebook, while I felt all the heavily disapproving stares and comments from all the rest of the 22 or so students in my class who likely assumed I was culturally inept to belong in their country, let alone community. In hindsight it sounds ridiculous now but, back then I really believed I had committed a grave sin worthy of discipline low-key reminiscent to a teacher in a dictatorship disciplining me for not immediately acknowledging or respecting a reference to the current leader.<br><br>All this to say, after watching this video, it finally dawned on me why my teacher acted in the manner she did that day. I had simply not recognized a such a great Late Night Talk Show legend in the making; Conan O&#39;Brien, my sincerest apologies to you 🙇‍♂️🙏 may you live a long and healthy blessed life.❤",

The man who accompanied Steve that day even said it was Steves fault.

I do believe that our own government was also involved from Lyndon Johnson down to George Bush Sr. to Woody Harrelsons dad. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised the American people bought that dumbass story about Oswald being the shooter, as well as the Warren Commission Report. Let&#39;s use some common sense here people. Jack Ruby himself had a gambling problem and/or was skimming from the Mob owned restaurant/nightclub he was running to cover his debts and was into the big guys for a fair amount of money. My speculation here is it was put to him that either he take care of Oswald or his ass was going into the nearest swamp in Louisiana, never to be heard from again.",

Ronnie (his beam doesn&#39;t just cut it disintegrates, then he destroyed the planet) <br>3. Homelander (its like an eye lightsaber it cuts fast but it is not as strong power wise. eg how long it took for his beams to murder the first ceo in the show)<br><br>Not included in the top 3 list are: <br>Cyclops (due to his mutant ability his eyes are actually doorways to a domain of power, he is disqualified)<br>Darkseid (due to him actually being a living concept, he is disqualified)<br>Ikaris (due to him just being bad at it, he is disqualified)<br>Jack Jack (due to insufficient information and age, his powers may grow or, (because he has 23 powers) they may stay at the level they currently are because of power balance.) <br>Thanos (lack of use)<br>Captain Marvel (lack of use)<br>Starfire (many different opinions due to multiple versions of character)<br><br>I look forward to any discussions. 🙂",

This is liberation and the shredding of the entire reality a Narcissistic person so comfortably lived in for so long. Shredded to pieces HARMONIOUSLY 🤟🤟🤟🤟 THE TRUTH IS A BEAST YOU CANNOT ESCAPE, IF YOU ARENT WITH IT YOUR AGAINST IT, AND TO BE AGAINST THE TRUTH IS TO BE AGAINST SOMEONE AND SOMETHING UNDEFEATED UNBREAKEABLE UNSHAKEABLE AND IS THE VERY ONE EVEN DEMONS THEMSELVES ARE TERRIFIED OF WHILE ALL THESE PANSIES RUN AROUND THINKING ITS THE SHIT TO BE EVIL AND WORSHIP AND SUPPORT EVERYTHING AGAINST GOD THROWING A TANTRUM OVER NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND GOD BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO SELF ENTITLED TO GO TO GOD DIRECTLY SEEKING THE TRUTH AND UNDERSTANDING OF HIM AND INSTEAD THEY PUT THEIR FAITH IN HUMAN BEINGS TO MAKE SENSE OF IT FOR THEM AND BECAUSE IT WASNT DONE CORRECTLY, AND BECAUSE THEY DIDNT SEEK AFTER IT THEMSELVES LIKE AN ADULT BUT RATHER DEMANDED IT TO BE SERVED TO THEM RIGHT OFF THE BAT WHEN IF THEY WANTED IT THEY WOULD HAVE CHASED AFTER IT AND FOUND IT, BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT JUST GIVE EVERYONE FULL UNDERSTANDING AND TRUTH OF ALL THINGS. NOT EVERYONE TRUELY DESIRES IT, AND MOST THAT DO DESIRE THE TRUTH OF GOD, ONLY DESIRE TO USE IT FOR CONTROL AND TO TRY TO USE IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE, BECAUSE THEY COULD ACTUALLY CARE LESS, DUE TO THEIR HEARTS BEING FOR THIS WORLD AND THE THINGS IN IT. THIS IS THE REPROBATION THAY OVERCOMES THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO PERSISTENTLY LIVE WITH HIDDEN MOTIVES AND SELFISH AGENDAS THINKING THEY ARE ENTITLED TO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND IF THEY DONT GET WHAT THEY WANT, THEY THROW A GROWN ADULT TANTRUM. SO MANY PEOPLE, OPENLY DO ALL TYPES OF PAGAN THINGS, AND IT IS BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY HAVE MORE OF A UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE THINGS THEN THEY EVER DID GOD, AS THEY FELT GOD IGNORED THEM OR JUST DIDNT CARE. I USED TO THINK GOD IGNORED ME TOO. UNTIL I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND HOW ALL I EVER SAID TO HIM WAS &quot;PLEASE GIVE ME A SIGN&quot;, NOT TO MENTION WHAT I SAID TO HIM WHEN I BLAMED HIM FOR MY PROBLEMS LIKE A BRAINDEAD CORNY FOOL. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND HOW WE ARE TOLD THAT ALL FLESH IS 100% EVIL, THAT THERE IS NO ONE GOOD ON THE EARTH, NO, NOT ONE, AND HOW IF I WAS GOD, HOW I WOULD FEEL IF THOSE I LOVE DEARLY ONLY HAD A &quot;PLEASE GIVE ME A SIGN&quot; TO SAY TO ME, AND HOW I COULD CLEARLY SEE THEIR HEARTS DESIRE AND HIDDEN INTENT, AND HOW SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SO EVIL AND IN THE WRONG AND HAVE BETRAYED GOD SO BAD, AND BLAMED HIM FOR THEIR PROBLEMS AS IF HES SUPPOSED TO STOP ALL EXSISTANCE AND BREAK HIS PROMISE OF US ALL HAVUNG FREE WILL JUST TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS, AS IF GOD IS ONLY THERE TO SERVE YOU, AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, AS IF GOD OWES YOU SOMETHING, AS IF HE HASNT ALREADY GIVEN YOU THE EARTH, THE SEA, THE SUN THE MOON AND THE STARS, AND THE VERY LIFE YOU HAVE AND BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS, BUT BC THINGS GO WRONG OR PEOPLE USE THEIR OWN FREE WILL TO DO HORRIBLE THINGS ITS APPARENTLY HIS FAULT, WHEN WE ARE TOLD THAT GOD LOVES ALL OF US SO MUCH, THAT IT IS FAR BEYOND THE ABILITY TO EVER UNDERSTAND....SO THIS MEANS EVEN THOSE WHO WRONG US OR OTHERS, GOD IS ALSO WAITING FOR THEM AND GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS AND BELIEFS AND TURN TO HIM AND FINALLY BE ALIVE ENTIRELY AND BELIEVE IN HIS SON JESUS CHRIST AND REPENT AND CHANGE THEIR MIND ABOUT LIFE AND BEING HORRIBLE TO OTHERS, BECAUSE GOD LOVES ALL OF US AND WANTS US ALL TO HAVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE, HE ISNT GOING TO DROP EVERYTHING TO SOLVE JUST ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS, NOT TO MENTION WE ARE LITERALLY PROMISED TO BE PROTECTED AND PROVIDED FOR BY GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRIST AND THE AUTHORITY HE HAS AND THE AUTHORITY HE ALSO GAVE US, AND SIMPLY BELIEVEING 100% THAT HE WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOURS AS YOU BELIEVE IN HIS ABILITY TO FULLY DO THAT, AND YOU KNOW N.O.T.H.I.N.G. IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD AND NOTHING IS TOO HARD FOR HIM TO DO. NOT TO MENTION, THE YOKE OF FOLLOWING JESUS IS EASY AND HIS BURDEN IS LIGHT, BECAUSE GOD MAY HAVE GIVEN US FREE WILL, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SAVEING OUR LIVES, HE DID EVERY SINGLE THING HIMSELF THROUGH JESUS CHRIST AND SEALED US ALL THE FREE GIFT OF SALVATION ETERNALLY AS JESUS TOOK OUR PLACE ON THE CROSS AND TOOK THE PUNISHMENT FOR OUR SINS UPON HIMSELF BECAUSE ONLY HE IS HOLY AND CLEAN AND PURE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE DEBT OF THE SINS OF ALL MANKIND PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE, AND HE HAS DEFEATED DEATH, THE GRAVE, AND THE DRAGON, AND HAS WON YOU AND ALL OF US, THE WAY BACK HOME FOR SURE 100%, AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE IN HIM AND LOVE GOD WITH YOUR WHOLE HEART AND SPIRIT AND SOUL. WHEN YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT ALL THIS, AND REALISE GOD IS NOT LIMITED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE HIM SEEM LIKE TO YOU, AND THAT YOUR PERCEPTION CAN ALSO BE WRONG SOMETIMES, THEN YOU CAN KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO FINALLY KNOW GOD AS HE TRUELY IS, IS ACTUALLY VERBALLY SPEAK TO GOD IN A PRIVATE PLACE SO YOU NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT BEING JUDGED, AND TO ASK TO WITNESS AND ENCOUNTER THE TRUTH COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED BY MAN, UNTOUCHED BY LIES, UNTOUCHED BY ANYTHING THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY FROM THE FATHER OF TRUTH, THE ONE TRUE GOD OF ALL EXSISTANCE, THE LORD OF THE HIGHEST WHITEST BRIGHTEST PUREST LIGHT GROUNDED IN PURE LOVE AND PURE TRUTH, SO YOU NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO EVER WONDER AND YOU NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO PLACE YOUR FAITH IN MANKIND TO EVER DELIVER IT TO YOU KNOWING THEY WONT. THIS ENTIRE REALITY IS MASKED BY TOO MANY MISREPRESENTED VERSIONS OF GOD AND PEOPLE THINKING THATS HIM, NOT EVEN GIVING HIM THE RIGHT TO SHOW THEM WHO HE TRUELY IS, BECAUSE THEY DIDNT CARE ABOUT HIM AT ALL TO EVEN CONSIDER SEEKING IT, WHICH IS WHY THEY END UP IN REPROBATION, UNDER THE GREAT DECEPTION OF THEIR OWN NARCISSISTIC SOULS.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t care what anyone says, but I found out God is very real just by being honest and respectful. It seems alot of us are too self absorbed to do this. The truth is free. But only those who truely desire it with their heart and not their evils will find it",
    "9893": "When I met God, I had a vision of a outline of a man playing the guitar in the clouds surrounded by flashing lightning followed by rumbles of thunder and the man I only saw his outline but he was flashing silvery rainbow rapidly and he had long hair, and was headbanging and his hair was makeing a brutal circle going round and round just getting into it, and shredding the fuck out of the entire atmosphere. I&#39;ll never forget that. The guitar in this, gives me the feeling that vision did. And yes, I was sober. Yes, this shit is real, and it all depends on how real you are with yourself and God, respectfully and lovingly and cautious of your urge to ask for a sign, when really you need to tell him how you feel about him and if he&#39;s real you just want the truth directly from him, And that you&#39;re not demanding it or testing him, But you just want the truth. If that&#39;s the truth then you will see what happens next. If you have hidden motives, Think again. God knows how this one ends 🤟",

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.<br>John 3:14‭-‬21 KJV<br>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works&#39; sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<br>John 14:11‭-‬18 KJV<br>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br>Ephesians 6:10‭-‬13 KJV<br><br>🎉‭Philippians‬ ‭2:1‭-‬11‬ ‭NIV‬\r<br>[1] Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, [2] then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. [3] Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, [4] not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. [5] In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: [6] Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; [7] rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. [8] And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross! [9] Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, [10] that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, [11] and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br><br>🎉And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb&#39;s wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; and had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: on the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there. And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb&#39;s book of life.<br>Revelation 21:1‭-‬27 KJV",

[22] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. [23] For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. [24] Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. [25] Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; [26] that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, [27] that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. [28] So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. [29] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: [30] for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. [31] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. [32] This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

    "10178": "This video brought back some good memories. This one time a buddy and neighbor of mine who is a retired NAVY SEAL needed some extra money. So he was given a US government assassination project in Bosnia. He was really excited about it. So one night he came over like a kid on Christmas to show me his new specs before being deployed. He had a new silencer and a red laser toy for his pistol. I let him in and he said, &quot;Check this out!&quot; He screwed the silencer into the barrel and turned out the lights. He put a bead around the room before putting it right between my eyes then over to my then future first ex wife. He and I started laughing and I told him, &quot;Hell yeah man that&#39;s freaking cool!&quot; She freaked out and started screaming. lol So we had to calm her down before he left. The next morning two FBI agents showed up at my door asking if I know this guy and about him buying a silencer and laser specs. I said, &quot;Yeah. He&#39;s a friend and neighbor of mine who bought those specs legally in part of an assassination project in Bosnia he is about to leave for. He&#39;s a good guy go talk to him.&quot; Those agents just stared at me a moment. Then looked at each other then back at me. Then said, &quot;Oh. Well, we just wanted to make sure you are comfortable with that information. Do you feel safe?&quot; I said yes. So they went to talk to him. Later that day he came over to my place looking pissed and said, &quot;Did you talk to the FBI about me?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah of course I did man!&quot; He asked what I told them and I replied. He stared at me for a tic then said, &quot;Oh my God thank you bro!&quot; Then gave me one those gross sweaty man hugs. Afterwards we threw a party for him at my bosses house who was in Air America for the CIA to send him off. Which ironically one my female coworkers who was drunk off her ass called me an asshole for no reason, other than my then girlfriend was a twat. Long story short, he completed his mission and came home safely. Haven&#39;t seen any of those people since. Aside from when I had to go to work for the DoD a short time after. Dude in the video looks just like him. Funny ole world isn&#39;t it? He is a big ole marshmallow truthfully. A titty baby. I tried to invite the FBI agents inside to chill but they weren&#39;t interested in all of that though. I got banned from Tik Tok and Facebook for talking about these things. Or maybe it was me admitting my ex girlfriend in the FBI after all this transpired is so freaking hot you can&#39;t put a ring or declaration of love to her. 💙 Without her breaking your heart, sons. She loves you more than you know. 💛 Don&#39;t spook her off! Because she isn&#39;t a ghost or an asshole. She is a government watch dawg for the FBI. Don&#39;t eat the artichoke or put salt on your salad. Don&#39;t be a stick in the mud. Be nice. Just some advice. Take care of yourselves. <br>~ Love Dad<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/y80Pc4u9YEw\">https://youtu.be/y80Pc4u9YEw</a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/zLlbzlS6_Lk\">https://youtu.be/zLlbzlS6_Lk</a>",

So she knows from a young age what her father does and why he has to leave her every now and then, but he will always come home to her. He knows, through his mother, what it feels like to be abandoned and he doesn&#39;t want his daughter to ever have to feel that. He assures her that no matter where he is, he is always with her and will never leave her. Many fathers did not have this opportunity and had to leave their beloved children behind. My older daughter is one of those kids and I wish he would come home to her every damn day. I want the song for my funeral because my death is a “coming home” for me. Simply a beautiful song 🖤🎶",

    "10412": "Does it really get any CHEESIER and more LAUGHABLE than <b>this</b> band, including their songs and lyrics, which tries to pawn themselves off as legit metalcore?!? Ummm....no. 😅 <br><br>They&#39;ve kept proving without a doubt that they are completely cliche in every possible way because they&#39;ve brought absolutely NOTHING new to this genre ever. They totally ripped off and used nearly word-for-word some of the lyrics from Ozzy Osbourne&#39;s &#39;Crazy Train,&#39; K-C and JoJo&#39;s &#39;All My Life,&#39; and other bands that I won&#39;t waste my time pointing out, just in this one song alone.<br><br>If you watch this video entitled &#39;Engine 45,&#39; you will see a wolf running in the snow that decides to suddenly catch major air by jumping for seemingly no reason whatsoever 😂, and then tries to look all badass by circling a bloody dagger that&#39;s sticking out of concrete blocks. That stupidity ends about 25% of the way through the video, and then the remaining 75% is redundant stupidity showing this wolf licking the dagger over and over and over until the end of the video. 🤣🤣🤣<br><br>You&#39;d think that collectively any 5 band members could come up with a video of something (literally anything!?!) that lasts more than a quarter of the video, and would actually make any sense whatsoever so as to match up in some way to the title and lyrics of &#39;Engine 45.&#39;<br><br>If you happen to be into metalcore, I promise you there are literally hundreds of bands that are much more talented instrumentally, lyrically and in every other way, than this band of chump-change musicians. I would move right along here, folks, there&#39;s literally nothing to see here at all. 😄<br><br>As stated by The Ghost Inside, they&#39;re a little bit like Unearth and As I Lay Dying, with a little less guitar solos and a little less singing...yet they have two guitarists that cannot play a guitar solo to save their lives (despite listing one of the guitarists as the &quot;lead&quot; guitarist 🙄), have a singer who is not fit to even hold the dirty jockstraps of the singers in Unearth and AILD and have a complete lack of powerful or intelligent riffs beyond power chords. It is blatantly clear, however, that they chose to name drop by throwing both of those band&#39;s names out there, so that people might think The Ghost Inside could be awesome...until the moment a person invests 30 seconds of their life listening to a song by them...and then realizes they got completely duped. 💁🏼‍♀️",

    "11586": "I feel like you couldve done better with that $40. That $8 monorail was unnecessary if youre going on a budget. Im from LA, so not a Nevada resident. There was a day where i was by myself and i did something similar to this because i didnt want to gamble. Spent time with one group of friends from Sunday to Wednesday, then they left on Thursday and i was by myself since my other group of friends were coming from Friday to Sunday. I booked my complimentary two nights for wed night and thursday night since most comp nights are available from sunday to thursday. So i spent entire Thursday by myself and ive tried something similar. I stayed at the Orleans but their shuttles are free to everyone and it connects u from Orleans all the way to the Strip near Harrahs and also to Downtown Vegas near Fremont. I took full advantage of this. So not a single penny on transportation. I did cheat because i put Grey Goose in my large flask. But there are places i drank such as Stage Door Casino where its only $1 beer, $2 patron shots. Ate at Blondie&#39;s for brunch for $7($5 + tax + tip), Ellis Island for dinner for $13($9.99 steak special + tax + tip). Walked around entire strip. There&#39;s also a small spot i forgot what it was called but ate a slice of pizza in the middle for $3.(pizza sucked. I dont recommend it. Wish i knew the name of the place so i can tell people not to go there.) I checked out nearly every casino and signed up for player&#39;s card and came with free play $10-$25 and thats the only way i gambled. Bought a Vegas shotglass for $5. While gambling using free play money, i got myself bunch of free drinks plus tip(each drink and i spent $10 on tips, so over 10 drinks). <br>$7 Blondies for brunch<br>$13 Ellis Island steak special<br>$5 stage door casino(1 shot patron, 1 beer + $2 tip)<br>$5 souvenir shotglass<br>$10 tips for drinks while playing games<br>$3 nasty pizza<br>Total: $43<br>Of course, i had a large 8oz flask of Grey Goose. So that helped a lot to make sure im wasted. 😁",

Place some of the bread on your little plate.<br>3. Tear off a bite size piece of your bread on your plate.<br>4. Butter just that little piece, using the butter on your little plate. <br>5. Put the entire bite-sized piece into your mouth. <br>Doing it this way saves you from gnawing awkwardly on a loaf of baguette. 😉",

As I was trying to find the parking lot I did see a new IV therapy place, but it wasn&#39;t open so that&#39;s good for me. We usually beat their prices anyway so it&#39;s good !! Also I did go there on opening night I missed Cher,but I heard people talking about her walking by and we also got a hand pay for 1,208 which is not good ,but at least we won money and now we have to pay taxes on it and it took the lady 2 1/2 hours to pay us we didn&#39;t even get home till 4:30 in the morning😢 there was a man next to me betting 88 cents and he won $10,000 that&#39;s crazy !!",

And Cher died Miss Clueless… $15 for a Burger $8 for a slice of Pizza Hilarious, The Monty Carlo Hotel room service Pizza 16 inch is 9 euros thats $7,36 . This is the very reason Las Vegas lost the EUROPEAN Tourist,s and the UK 🇬🇧.. They wont be ripped off, We got more sense….

    "11866": "I can attest to how good In-N-Out is. Yes, I’m a California resident and native, so I’m a bit biased. Also, must try secret menu item: Neapolitan shakes.<br><br>Yes, Neapolitan shakes. So delish 😋",

    "11868": "I want another shot! So much hadn’t been built when I was there 30 years ago!<br><br>The Welcome Sign was a drive-by attraction, pictures were hard. Would like to get closer!<br>New York New York, Paris Hotel and Bellagio hadn’t been built. Treasure Island was being built when I left. <br>I never got lost at Ceasars Palace 🤔😁😂<br>Amazing! I never tried In-N-Out 😞It didn’t occur to me I would leave before having it. It’s like White Castle which is mostly Midwest and NY metro. Sure there are a few in NM and FL, but if you’ve never been, it’s an experience. <br><br>I mentioned this in someone else’s video so I’ll say it here too: You were very careful to say walking around with an open non-glass container/drink is acceptable on both the Strip and Downtown/Fremont St., but failed to differentiate that it’s still illegal everywhere else. 30 years ago you could have one in a paper bag on the streets; as long as it was somewhat hidden it was ok, which is different from most other cities where even that’s illegal. Has this changed? Please update!<br><br>The Stratosphere… Thank you for some views from the observation deck. I’m afraid of heights and couldn’t get near the windows. I was actually experiencing a little vertigo just watching the video..<br><br>Downtown/Old Town: originally the overhang wasn’t an LED screen, I have to see it now. They talked about putting in canals on the side streets back then, since you didn’t mention them I take it that never happened??<br><br>Area15 looks interesting. <br><br>Thanks for another great video.., I’m slowly working through them all. You mentioned watching them several times in another vid, I can do this but I was under the impression YouTube only pays on unique views. Am I wrong? If you get paid, I’ll watch them all 100 times!!

Many times, I would rather have a really good prime rib rather than a steak, especially if the prime rib is properly cooked at  medium rare.  The one you showed with all the sides was a HUGE bargain at $16.99!   Well done, as always!  The video, never the steaks! 😃",

It&#39;s very cheap and easy to shave it as often as you want with just soap or lotion (I use a foil shaver that takes about 15 - 20 minutes a day, but I&#39;m retired) and it&#39;s the most liberating thing you can do for yourself... besides that simple meditation to still the mind.<br>Sorry to sound like a creepy old man, but you would be sexier than you think if you were bald... as most women would.<br>Also, I think you over spend on food!<br>All you need to be healthy is mostly canned food and a little bit of healthy now and then... But I understand you live to eat and that&#39;s fine.<br>I&#39;m not worried about your spending at all.  You&#39;re a star and you&#39;ll do just fine no matter what you do 👍🙏💕🙂<br>You&#39;re a trail blazer and I admire you for that and would like to see more of you and Lydia in your natural environment, which is pretty much anywhere...

    "12505": "I recently learned about John&#39;s and Seth&#39;s relationship from interviews after this interaction from November 2020. Just about a month before the intervention John his friends had with and for him. I also saw John&#39;s last show, Baby J, describing this intervention. This segment is somewhat painful to watch knowing what John was going through at the time, and Seth probably realising it. I also feel so, SO much love watching this.<br>Friendship and love between men is so f@*%ing underrated ❤",

    "12509": "Towards the end of the interview it almost felt like Seth was giving the eulogy he would have given at John’s funeral. I hope that never happens. 😢",
    "12510": "This interview was right before an intervention was arranged for John. At this point in time he was addicted to adderall, Xanax, cocaine and Percocet. If you watch Johns body language and his manner of speaking it’s evident that John is probably under the influence and definitely miserable. I admire him so much because he went to rehab and is now sober. When I see him doing a bit now he looks healthy and happy. Plus he is funnier than ever! He’s been through so much and he is a true inspiration to those struggling with addiction.  Hats off to you John!❤",

His reaction to when he realizes where he&#39;s putting it, and what might be seen from the outside - you see him clearly react quickly by closing it shut, and opening only very slightly the 2nd time to try to put the pad of paper in there. In fact, he doesn&#39;t even put it in the pocket. So its almost like he&#39;s on auto-pilot, just trying to hang on to any semblance of sobriety and meaningful presence. <br><br>I say this as someone who has had plenty of problems with addiction and mental health. I&#39;ve been where he was at here. His new special on netflix is surprisingly relatable... I never got into his stuff until now. Probably because I couldn&#39;t see past his detached affect back then 😔",

Voter fraud lies is the fastest acid test of which politicians are LIARS. <br><br>I rewatched just to enjoy Biden&#39;s win again. Smartmatic should get $2.7 million more from Fox for their blatent election lies. This country is much better off in Biden and Democrat hands. The media and especially the news is the 1% who don&#39;t want to be taxed or have their power curtailed. Hopefully Trump will finally be in jail for trying to overturn the 2024 election. How much did it cost us in recounts and court cases because his ego was too fragile to admit he lost? I hope they strip him of every dime he has to reimburse the taxpayers. Happy 2024!

I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can’t even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn’t even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren’t for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn’t have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what’s really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I’ll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times.

People always be supporting zuko but trashing Azula when season one Zuko is LEGIT EXACTLY the same as Azula is, the only difference is SHE’s actually competent 🤷🏻‍♂️ Zuko had Iroh for YEARS guiding him with unconditional love and rarely ever any judgement for his MULTIPLE bad behaviors and he STILL double-crossed him and help MURDER Aang. But he gets a free pass and people say Azula doenst even deserve help. She’s just as much a victim of her father just in a COMPLETELY different way than zuko was. The way Ozai neglected Zuko emotionally Ursa did a pretty similar thing mentally to Azula. Her breakdown at the end is honestly one of the saddest thing in the franchise, the girl was only 14. One of the few things I’ll criticize Iroh for is his refusal to help Azula the way he did Zuko. I understand zuko became a surrogate for his son and needed him so badly after Ursa left but Azula CLEARLY needed somebody OTHER than her father grooming her too, and it sucks she didn’t get that. 🤷🏻‍♂️ still holding out hope her and Zuko eventually reconcile, and he does for Azula what Iroh did for him 🙏🏻",

    "14905": "I can say now that I&#39;m grown and that I hid from the things this little girl is so strong to stand up to. As a kid I also saw people and much scarier things that shouldn&#39;t bleed thru to our world. After years of torture and being harassed by shadow people, one specifically I called the rubber man, he was blacker than black and shiny, and also a 2ft troll of some kind that my mother also saw. We didn&#39;t tell each other for 6 months. Things would jump on our beds and growl in our faces. Our piano would play at random times after my husband brought home a brief case from a garage sale. I know some ghosts need help, but I wasn&#39;t in a place to do that and I think that&#39;s why I attracted the nastiest of the paranormal. These children are so intelligent and kind and strong, the support they have is amazing. One of my friends was upset because I saw her dad walk thru a room, I didn&#39;t know what to say? We were close so I just explained what I saw with as much detail as I could. She pulls out a picture and he&#39;s wearing the same black and white flannel I just described. She had been trying to see him for a few years and couldn&#39;t understand why it didn&#39;t happen for her but it did for me. We decided to go to a spiritual camp in Florida for the weekend so she could speak with a psychic. This camp had Dr&#39;s with their PHD&#39;s from all over the world who come and study for months. Sorry this is long but there&#39;s a point lol. Immediately getting there I wasn&#39;t feeling well, when I opened the door to our room I saw a woman for 1 sec but I described her by detail, brown hair in a bun, delicate features, high lace collar dress with a ribbon in her hair, I gasped a second 😂 when I saw her I am always thrown off even tho I see it everyday! So  that night we were supposed to go on a small walk to where the lay lines are located basically I guess it&#39;s easier to reach the other side. Sort of like a portal I&#39;m assuming? But before that we went on a walk and I smelled the most awful smell as an animal must have died... She didn&#39;t smell it and I knew because it&#39;s happened before, I knew it was bad. Finally night comes for our walk to the area where we should see orbs, and to my surprise I saw 2 nobody else saw. I wasn&#39;t feeling well so I told my friend to enjoy herself and I walked up to sit outside at a table by the restaurant. I saw a woman across the area and she asked to join me 😊 well of course!!! But the next thing out of her mouth shook me, do you know you are a very powerful psychic? I just froze lol... I mentioned we were there to learn about her dad but I&#39;ve pretty much known something was going on with me. My entire life has been this way and now I&#39;m facing it straight on. I said what does that mean exactly. She explained she has psychic abilities but I have all the abilities and most have one. This was me 😳 years I&#39;ve known all my life, I know when celebrities are going to pass which is awful to say but I see it in my mind and it happens. Mentioning this to my friends is a buzz kill but I mean you try being me. I was then told by this person that she has never seen so many dead people around one psychic. 30, there were 30. I was then later stopped by one of the DRs the next day as she was passing by and she asked if we could talk a min. Again, of course! I have to tell you I&#39;ve never seen someone with 3 spirit guides. She named one of these spirit guides and my mouth dropped. When I was born I was covered completely in a white veil and if you know native American history this means something. My mom took me to a shaman to see what this meant because we have family who still live on reservations. He explained to her what it meant, gave me a blessing and I learned all this when I was a teenager. When she said the name of my spirit guide, same name as the shaman!! Deango, I know I&#39;m spelling it all wrong. But my mom could not believe they knew the name. So this DR. Then tells me I have many abilities and she would like to teach me how to live with this and how to use it. She said I have the ability to see people for one second but I see them in my mind in full detail, I know things before they happen, I have the ability somehow to think of something and it will happen but in the way say I&#39;m thinking man I wish I had some iced tea and my husband comes home with it? This is a daily occurrence so am I the problem or are we just linking up I have no idea 😂😂 she said I know past things I shouldn&#39;t know, I can see things from other dimensions, like the shadow people and the troll. How did she know all this? She was running a class every Wednesday night and basically wanted me to be the main event 😳 still not sure about all that but I&#39;m getting better at accepting it. I lived an hour away so there was no way for me to commit to every Wednesday but the time I spent there was very educational. Learning to use my abilities the way these beautiful children do ❤ sorry it&#39;s a long one 😬",

What this little has is something different to me although she may be similar in many ways to me. These are powers or gifts that we have. I can hear spirits too but not as strong as her. I can read people and I can feel energy fields. People give off energy, and I am sorry to say this the energy or thoughts that people have aren’t good, their intentions aren’t good and I can feel everyone of them. It really drains my energy to the point where it’s hard to breath. I can only spend a little time around people. I do have people that I converse with who are beautiful souls so I do have friends.

And he has broken that promise and i’m trying to get over self harm and i keep having to self harm…because i blame myself for his problems.. i used to like him 4 years ago, but he keeps saying he will kill himself so randomly, and it hurts… a lot. i tried to force myself to like him but it’s just impossible because i’m a lesbian.. i feel so bad. today he said he wanted to to something risky that could ruin something.. i knew he wanted to kiss me before he went on  vacation. i feel so bad and i think if he kissed me then he might feel better and get over me.. but this is my FIRST KISS i’m talking about… i- don’t want him to me my first kiss.. i don’t know.. i’m scared. he told me that he wanted to kiss me but i already knew because i can see through people super super easily….. got any suggestions yall? 😞",

Visualize space as a medium instead of a flat fabric, which gets more dense the more mass forms, time also slows down near more mass, and seems to speed up for less massive objects in more spread out space ? I guess because it&#39;s hard to visualize and describe with words, physicists invented symbols with which to write formulas.🤨😁",

It&#39;s like a force that pushes towards a mass, not a pull from or by that mass, you even said that the fabric of space nudges earth around the sun ! Unless you see it as a larger mass pulling the fabric of space/time towards it and all smaller masses in the vicinity along with it...🤔",

    "20200": "This is such a mind f**l in terms of London geography I had to click on KT just to understand how many things went wrong with this image.<br><br>So. If i were to look at the big ben and parliament from the opposite side of Westminster, to being with, the big ben and parliament would be on the left, not right.<br>Sono considered &quot;maybe this image is flipped?&quot; But it still did not make sense for how it would look from the south bank and that&#39;s when I realised the building next to the big ben are actually the other side of the bridge. Follow me: it means that flr how the buildings are placed the bridge should actually be going from right to left, not from top to bottom of this image. I lived in londong for a decade so my best guess is: the background of the picture with the big ben and buildings is actually shown from the perspective of the pedestrian bridge next to Charing cross railway bridge. And the &quot;bridge&quot; we see coming towards us that poses as Westminster bridge Is actually just a random bridge (also because Westminster bridge does not have a rail to divide the pavement from the road). This was interesting but yeah, if you feel like experiencing the feeling of London and then visit and can&#39;t find this place it&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t exists like this 😅",
